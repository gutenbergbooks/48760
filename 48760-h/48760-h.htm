<span class="i0"><em>Slow rises worth, by poverty depress'd.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="sig1">
Dr. Johnson.<br />
</p>


<p>Numerous and important are the
boasted advantages of our free government.
Men and things are professedly
estimated, in this region of
sturdy republicanism, in exact accordance
with their true character.
Our just and beautiful theories inculcate
the doctrine, that <span class="smcap">VIRTUE</span> and
<span class="smcap">TALENT</span> are the only proper grounds
of distinction in society; and if this
were faithfully illustrated in practice,
merit would not be opposed by serious
obstacles, in emerging from obscurity.
If such a desirable state of
things were realized, how rapidly
would our country advance in prosperity!
Monarchical institutions, which
sanction the hereditary descent of
<span class="smcap">RANK</span> and <span class="smcap">DISTINCTION</span>, would contrast
very unpleasantly with those
which are bottomed on the cardinal
principle, that all men are by <span class="smcap">NATURE
CREATED EQUAL</span>. It becomes us
therefore to inquire, whether the fancied
superiority, which in relation to
this subject, we arrogate to ourselves,
be in reality any thing but in
name.</p>

<p>In prosecuting this inquiry, let personal
observation, and personal experience,
be candidly consulted. If we
have voluntarily substituted, for what
in other countries results from the
exercise of despotic power, an idol of
our own creation, and bow to it with
the same deference and fealty, what
becomes of our claim to the title of
independence? The effect of such a
deception will be no less productive
of mental and moral degradation, than
if the laws of the land had authorized
the establishment of <span class="smcap">PRIVILEGED ORDERS</span>.
The real republican character
is particularly distinguished by its
simplicity. The inroads of luxury,
and the inordinate influence of wealth,
are anxiously to be deprecated, as
destructive to rational liberty. Titles
of nobility are not within our reach;
but the glitter of wealth may equally
awaken our ambition, and monopolize
our attention. Here there is danger,
against the approach of which it is
the part of prudence and of wisdom
to be vigilant.</p>

<p>When an individual is supposed to
be affluent, have we ever known his
merit to be unjustly overlooked or disregarded?
Are not riches uniformly
invested with the magic power of
extenuating the faults, and magnifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the good qualities of their possessor?
The answers to these questions will
at once be given without hesitation,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For virtue, glory, beauty, all divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And human powers, immortal Gold! are thine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The complexion of society in Philadelphia,
is considered, in many respects,
of that chastened and respectable
character, which is well becoming
the nature of our institutions. Our
metropolis has always been distinguished
for <em>Benevolence</em>, of which, as
well as of other good qualities, honourable
mention might be made.
But indiscriminate approbation must
be withheld, if we maintain our allegiance
to truth. There is in this city
an aristocracy of wealth, which has a
withering and destructive effect on
the best interests of social life.&mdash;Wealth,
in certain circles, is considered
an indispensable recommendation;
and perhaps in some instances,
the only one its possessor is required
to prefer! It is not pretended, that
this golden qualification should be
contemned in the abstract; for, when
not abused, it furnishes the means not
only of procuring many valuable and
rational gratifications, but of extensive
utility to others. But we err egregiously,
in permitting it to supplant,
in our estimation, the only distinctions
of real value;&mdash;those which have been
indicated above. Such a blind devotion
to its charms, casts a reflection
upon our character for good sense,
equally just and severe with that
which properly belongs to a retailer
of the stale and pointless bon-mots of
monarchs, for wit, merely because
they issue from the fountain of royalty.
This slavish subserviency, is
altogether unworthy of freemen; they
must, if true to themselves, discard
the influence of <span class="smcap">PRIVILEGED ORDERS</span>,
and view things as they really are.&mdash;Many
an individual, who now fills a
large space in the public eye, would,
if overtaken by adversity, scarcely be
discerned at all without the aid of a
microscope. He would, when deserted
by prosperity, return to his
native insignificance, and assume his
proper station in life.</p>

<p>Our conduct to all men should be
friendly and decorous, but to those
who are struggling with adverse circumstances,
and who possess sterling
recommendations to our notice, it
should be zealously and liberally extended.
The great man, to whom
we are indebted for our motto, knew
what it was to be beset by those potent
adversaries,&mdash;griping poverty, and
chilling neglect. He concluded one
of his letters to <span class="smcap">Cave</span>, the editor of
the Gentleman's Magazine, in these
remarkable words, "I am yours <span class="smcap">IMPRANSUS</span>."
If by this he intended to
convey the idea, that he was fasting
because he had not the means of procuring
a dinner, what a melancholy
reflection does it suggest to the mind.
Even Lord <span class="smcap">Chesterfield</span> himself,
whose delicate nerves were so dreadfully
shocked by the "<em>savageness</em>" of
<span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, had he been acquainted with
the circumstance, and foreseen his future
celebrity, would have hastened
to his relief. Who that beheld Dr.
<span class="smcap">Franklin</span>, in the garb of a printer's
boy, walking up Market Street, eating
one of his rolls of bread, and carrying
the other under his arm, could have
believed, that at a future period he
would become one of the most celebrated
men of the age. So deceptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
are external appearances, and so irresistible
must be the conclusion, that
<span class="smcap">VIRTUE</span> and <span class="smcap">TALENT</span> are not excluded
from the humblest walks of life.&mdash;Hence
the folly and injustice of establishing
<span class="smcap">PRIVILEGED ORDERS</span>.</p>

<p>So long ago as the days of <span class="smcap">Horace</span>,
the seductive power of gold was considered
as directly hostile to the cause
of virtue. The following lines are extracted
from his ode to his friend <span class="smcap">Sallust</span>,
as translated by Dr. <span class="smcap">Francis</span>.</p>

<h2>THE VILLAGE TEACHER.</h2>


<p>It was finely remarked by an Indian,
that the white man has not so deep and
intimate a sense of his dependence upon
God as the Indian. He owes more,
apparently, to himself and his fellows.
Entrenched in his palaces of stone, he
can smile at the pitiless storm, and
defy the blasts of winter. The great
business of his early life, is to provide
against its decline. He has artisans
to administer to every want, and to
alleviate every pain. Hence his own
importance is magnified in his view;
and he thinks less frequently of the
great Being, from whom all his comforts
spring. The Indian, on the other
hand, leads a life of privation and adventure.
He wanders alone through
the forest; and seeks companionship
and communion with nature. He
looks abroad on the majesty of creation,
and feels that there must be a
Deity. In the uncertainty of his
supplies of food, he knows that he is
at the mercy of an invisible Protector;
and the feeling of gratitude for unexpected
relief, is more vivid than can
enter into the heart of the civilized
man.</p>

<p>Without stopping to inquire into
the justice of the Indian's remark, I
shall go on to observe, that there is a
like difference between the occupations
of the city and country. Every
thing in a great metropolis is artificial.
As the division of labour is the great
secret of national wealth, so it is carried
to its greatest extent in the capital.
The members of the community
are there more interlocked with each
other, more helpless by themselves,
than is the case with us. Accordingly
they look to each other for the principal
part of their enjoyments. To
begin with the most necessary things
of life, a citizen is dependant upon a
dozen tradesmen, perhaps, for those
articles of food and clothing, which a
farmer works up at home. He accomplishes
himself for one object of
pursuit; and although profoundly ignorant
of all others, is enabled thereby
to fill his station, to keep his place
as a key-stone in the arch of society.
It never occurs to him how helpless
and impotent he would be by himself.
He is accommodated to things
around&mdash;the artificial creature of an
artificial system. Nor is it only in
this dependence upon his fellows, that,
the citizen differs from the countryman.
His contrivances against the
unavoidable evils and calamities of
life, are more numerous, and cast a
veil, in some degree, between him
and his Creator. The overruling of
that hand, which dispenses and withholds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the rain and the harvest, affect
him, as it were, but at a distance.&mdash;His
merchandise is the product of
art. His system of credit equalizes,
if I may use the expression, the dispensations
of Providence. The tempest
may bury his wealth in the bosom
of the deep; but an insurance
office repairs the ravage of the elements.
Every means in his power is
used to thwart the original decree,
"By the sweat of thy brow," &amp;c.&mdash;He
looks into futurity, and calculates
the unfruitfulness of the seasons&mdash;not
as a motive to humble dependence&mdash;not
as an incentive to prayer and repentance&mdash;but
that he may build his
fortune upon the wants and the casualties
of his fellow creatures. He
even grapples with death itself&mdash;calculates
with unfeeling selfishness the
days and the infirmities of his neighbours,
and wagers upon the length
of his life. All his arrangements are
predicated upon this artificial system.
The thought, if it ever occur to him,
of the great God of nature, is as much
shut out by it, as the fair face of creation
from the alleys and courts of the
city. And in proportion as he becomes
impressed with a deep sense
of that overruling Providence, will
these things become hateful in his
eyes. No doubt the mind is, as Milton
has it, "its own place," and can
transform the natural aliment of vice
into a medicament of virtue. The
noblest examples of active goodness
are generally to be found in a large
metropolis; for it must be virtue of a
superior cast that can resist the temptations
which are there presented.&mdash;But
minds of a contemplative turn
may be allowed to shun the combat
which they find it so hard to sustain,
and to seek for aids to their good resolutions
in external circumstances.</p>

<p>To all such I may venture to recommend
the pursuits of a country
life as eminently salutary. Every
month and week has there its appropriate
labours, which cannot be neglected;
and it is from this cause a
life of activity and variety. The
events of the season are full of interest,
and it is peculiarly delightful to
observe how Providence still delights
to bless. Shortsighted and presumptuous
that we are, we are constantly
auguring this or that misfortune&mdash;lamenting
the unpropitiousness in some
respect or another of the year; and
yet from harvest to harvest are our
barns filled, and our granaries laden.
The labours of the country do not,
like those of the city, deform the body,
and undermine the constitution;
and there is in its clear atmosphere,
and silent serenity, an influence as invigorating
to the soul as the touch of
earth to Antæus. In the country,
the silent and manifest workings of
the Deity are constantly before us,
and meet our eyes in every phase of
organized life: The mind must be
worse than insensible that does not feel
and respond to the voice of praise,
which seems to be constantly ascending,
as from one great altar.</p>

<p>Some philosophers have placed virtue
in a state of lofty contemplation;
and others, of continued activity. The
truth seems to be, that they are both
essential to the perfect character.&mdash;He
who gives himself up to indolent
meditation, will become a prey to the
enemies of his own household, and
will fall by a servile foe. He who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
never retires to "plume his feathers,
and let grow his wings," will find
himself less and less able to sustain
his flight; and discover, perhaps,
when it is too late, that he has lost
the energy of virtue, and the love of
moral beauty.</p>

<p>But as the temptations of the more
selfish passions are the strongest, that
state of society in which we are the
most exposed to them, is the most
dangerous; and we have more need
of having our eyes and our hearts
fixed upon pure and lofty objects,
than of having excessive stimulants
applied to that activity, of which every
condition in life requires a steady and
vigorous application. To reflecting
minds, therefore, the labour and the
relaxation which the country holds
out, are both more salutary and invigorating,
than that which is required
amid the smoke, and bustle, and jarring
interests of a great metropolis.</p>

<h2>AN ACCOUNT<br />

<span class="s07"><i>Of the Agricultural School at Hofwyl,<br />
in Switzerland.</i></span></h2>

<p class="center">(From the Edinburgh Review.)</p>


<p>Mr. de Fellenberg was first known
merely as an agriculturist, and still
keeps up his original establishment
of husbandry at Buchsie, an old chateau
near Hofwyl; but agriculture
was always with him a secondary object,
and subservient to that system
of education to which his thoughts
were very early directed. He is a
man of an unusually ardent as well as
persevering turn of mind, and conceals
a character of deep and steady
enthusiasm, under a very calm exterior
and manners. Although born
to patrician rank in his own country,
he early imbibed those political doctrines
of which such tremendous misapplication
was so soon to be made in
his neighbourhood: and the disappointment
filled his mind with melancholy
views of the moral state and
future prospects of mankind. It appeared
to him, that the world was
blindly hurrying on to irretrievable
ruin; and that a sounder system of
education for the great body of the
people, could alone stop the progress
of error and corruption. He has sometimes
mentioned in conversation the
particular circumstances, which finally
determined him to the course he
has since pursued. In the year 1798
or 1799, he happened to be at Paris
as one of the commission sent by the
provisional government established in
Switzerland after the French invasion;
and in that capacity he had an official
conversation with the Director Reubel,
at his country-house near Paris,&mdash;in
the course of which he laid before
him, in glowing colours, a picture of
the miserable state to which his country
was reduced, and which might
soon lead to a <em>Vendean</em> war, destructive
to both parties. The Director
appeared for some time to listen with
profound attention, and Mr. de Fellenberg
ascribed his silence to conviction
of the truths he urged, and
something like a feeling of compunction,&mdash;when,
all at once, the worthy
republican throwing open a window,
called aloud to one of his servants&mdash;'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jacques!
apportez moi Finette!</i>'
A little spaniel was brought accordingly
with its litter of young ones in
a basket&mdash;and there was no chance of
his hearing another word about Switzerland
or liberty! After this rebuff,
he gave up the idea of serving his
country as a politician; and, asking
for his passport the next day, made
the best of his way home, determined
to set about the slow work of elementary
reformation, by a better mode of
education, and to persevere in it for
the rest of his life!</p>

<p>It is now upwards of twelve years
since Mr. de Fellenberg undertook to
systematize domestic education, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to show on a large scale how the children
of the poor might be best taught,
and their labour at the same time
most profitably applied: in short, how
the first twenty years of a poor man's
life might be so employed as to provide
for his support and his education.
The peasants in his neighbourhood
were at first rather shy of trusting
their children for a new experiment;
and being thus obliged to take his
pupils where he could find them,
many of the earliest were the sons of
vagrants, and literally picked up on
the highways; and this is the case
with one or two of the most distinguished.
He had very soon, however,
the good fortune of finding an
excellent co-operator in the person of
a young man of the name of Vehrli,
the son of a schoolmaster of Thurgovia,
who, coming to Hofwyl in 1809,
to see the establishment and inform
himself of the mode of teaching, was
so struck with the plan of the <em>school
of industry</em>, that he offered his son,
then about 18, as an assistant. This
young man devoted himself from that
moment to the undertaking.&mdash;&mdash;Although
admitted at first to Mr. de
Fellenberg's table, he soon left it for
that of his pupils, with whom he has
ever since lived night and day. Working
with them in the fields, their playfellow
in their hours of relaxation,&mdash;and,
learning himself what he is to
teach as a master, his zeal has not
cooled a moment during a trial of
more than ten years' unremitting exertions,
under the guidance of his patron,
and assisted now by four other
masters. The number of his pupils
has increased successively to 43:
They obey him as well as Mr. de
Fellenberg, entirely from love and a
sense of duty:&mdash;punishment has been
inflicted only twice since the beginning;
and their treatment is nearly
that of children under the paternal
roof. They go out every morning to
their work soon after sunrise&mdash;having
first breakfasted and received a lesson
of about half an hour. They return
at noon. Dinner takes them half an
hour,&mdash;a lesson of one hour follows;
then to work again till six in the evening.
On Sunday, the different lessons
take six hours instead of two; and
they have butcher's meat on that day
only. They are divided into three
classes, according to age and strength;
an entry is made in a book, every
night, of the number of hours each
class has worked, specifying the sort
of labour done, in order that it may be
charged to the proper account, each
particular crop having an account
opened for it, as well as every new
building, the live stock, the machines,
the schools themselves, &amp;c. &amp;c. In
winter, and whenever there is no out-of-doors'
work, the boys plait straw for
chairs; make baskets; saw logs with
the cross saw, and split them; thrash
and winnow corn, grind colours, knit
stockings, or assist the wheel-wright
and other artificers, of whom there
are many employed on the establishment.
For all which different sorts
of labour an adequate salary is credited
each boy's class.</p>

<p>Mr. de Fellenberg indeed observes,
that the boys being most of them only
just come to the age of productive labour,
it is presumed the Establishment
will not only support itself in
future, but repay past expenses; particularly
as certain outfits charged to
the first years will not recur again.&mdash;He
observes also, that several grown
boys have been suffered to go away,
and have been replaced by young
children, to the great injury of the
Establishment. It may be added,
that the pupils have been indulged of
late with better clothes than formerly,
or than is strictly necessary, as well
as a better table; and that, from attention
to their feelings, the cast-off
clothes of the <em>school of the rich</em> are
not turned to their use, but given
away to the poor of the neighbourhood,
that they may not appear in the
light of dependants on any but their
adoptive father and their own labour.
It is undoubtedly a very striking circumstance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that only one, out of the
whole number of boys admitted into
this school since the beginning, has
been dismissed as irrecoverably vicious;
all the others have got rid of
their former habits;&mdash;and, when final
sentence was passed upon the unfortunate
boy, the others begged leave to
contribute each one <i>batz</i> towards a
present to him, that he might remember
them with kindness.</p>

<p>The labours of the field, their various
sports, their lessons, their choral
songs, the necessary rest, fill the
whole circle of the twenty-four hours;
and judging from their open, cheerful,
contented countenances, nothing
seems wanting to their happiness.&mdash;But
it is a great point gained, to have
brought young men to the age of 18
or 20, uncontaminated by the general
licentiousness which prevails in the
country. When their time is out,
and they mix with other people, they
will no doubt marry; but the probability
is, they will be more difficult in
their choice than other men of the
same rank, and will shrink from vulgarity
and abject poverty. Long habits
of self-restraint, too, will enable
them to look out with comparative
patience for a suitable establishment,
before they burden themselves with a
family. In short, if the only check
of the mild kind to an excessive increase
of population is self-restraint,
from motives of prudence and morality,
where may we look for it with
better hopes than among the pupils
of Mr. de Fellenberg?</p>

<p>We shall now proceed, however,
to lay before our readers a more detailed
account of the internal management
of the school of industry. The
lessons are given mostly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i>,
and various questions continually interposed,
respecting measures of capacity,
length and weight, and their
fractional parts; the cubic contents of
a piece of timber, or a stack of hay;
the time necessary to perform any
particular task, under such or such
circumstances; the effects of gravitation;
the laws of mechanics; rules
of grammar and different parts of
speech, &amp;c. &amp;c. The boys endeavour
to find the solution of arithmetical
and mathematical problems without
writing, and at the same time to
proceed with the mechanical processes
in which they may happen to
be engaged. Aware of the difficulties
with which they are thus made to
grapple, as it were, without assistance,
they are the more sensible of the
value of those scientific short cuts,
which carry you in the dark indeed,
but safely and speedily, to your journey's
end, and the more delighted
with their beauty as well as their use.
They acquire the <em>rationale</em> of the
thing, together with the practice;
their understandings are exercised,
and their attention kept awake. None
of them are ever seen to look inattentive
or tired, although just returned
from their day's labour in the fields.
Contrivance, and some degree of difficulty
to overcome, is a necessary
condition, it would seem, of our enjoyments.</p>

<p>The pupils are not always questioned,
but, in their turn, propose
questions to the masters, and difficulties
to be solved, which they do sometimes
with considerable ingenuity.&mdash;They
draw outlines of maps, from
memory, exhibiting the principal
towns, rivers, and chains of mountains;
they draw correctly from nature,
and in perspective, all sorts of
machines for agriculture; and are
very fond of trying chymically the
different sorts of soil, and have tables
of them very well arranged.</p>

<p>Various gymnastic games are also
practised occasionally; but mental
exercises find their place better after
hard labour: They do indeed in the
fields full as well as on the benches of
the school. For instance, when the
boys are employed in digging trenches
to irrigate a meadow, and while directing
the water along artificial ridges,
and round hills, so as to regulate the
fall and distribute the moisture equally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
they put each other in mind of
what they have heard about the laws
of hydraulics. When they clear a
field of the stones turned up by the
plough, and are directed to separate
those which are calcareous, in order
to be burned into lime, they know
and practise the different tests by
which their nature is ascertained, and
can point out in the horizon, the particular
mountains which have furnished
these various fragments.</p>

<p>In order to encourage the attachment
to property acquired by our
own industry, the pupils are allowed
certain emoluments, such as the proceeds
of the seeds they collect, some
part of their gleanings, and what they
raise in a small garden of their own;
all which accumulates, and forms a
fund for the time of their going away.
No ambitious views are fostered by
this mode of training the poorest
class, beyond that of being good husbandmen.
The pupils of the <em>school
of industry</em> are not raised above their
station; but their station, dignified
and improved, is raised to them. It
has been remarked before, that men
born in the poorest class of society,
constituted as it is at present, especially
those who subsist in part on
public charity, find it almost as difficult
to get out of their dependant situation
as a Hindoo to leave his cast,&mdash;kept
down as they are by a sort of
inbred ignorance and improvidence,
and, above all, by their multitude;
which is one of the worst consequences
of that improvidence. The higher
and middling ranks scarcely keep up
their numbers any where; while multiplication
goes on, unrestrained by
any consideration of prudence, precisely
among those who are least
able to support a family. The poor
may, in the bitterness of want, exclaim
against taxes and ill government, and
certainly not always without reason;&mdash;but
the worst government is their
own of themselves.</p>

<p><i>Agricultural labour</i> is not the only
occupation which can be made the
base of such an education. <i>Manufactures</i>,
with all their disadvantages,
might answer the purpose, provided
the children were not collected together
in vast numbers in the same
rooms&mdash;provided they were under
the care of intelligent and kind masters
and overseers, and were allowed
gardens of their own, and a certain
number of hours each day to work in
them, or take exercise in the open air&mdash;all
which must abridge necessarily
the time allotted to productive labour,
or to learning. One of the great advantages
of husbandry is, that it affords
sufficient exercise, and leaves
more time for mental improvement.
Such of Vehrli's pupils as have a
turn for any of the trades in demand
at Hofwyl&mdash;wheelwright, carpenter,
smith, &amp;c. tailor or shoemaker&mdash;are
allowed to apply to them. These
boys will leave the Institution at the
age of one-and-twenty, understanding
agriculture better than any peasants
ever did before, besides being practically
acquainted with a trade, and
with a share of learning quite unprecedented
among the same class of
people; and yet as hard-working and
abstemious as any of them, and with
the best moral habits and principles.
It seems impossible to desire or imagine
a better condition of the peasantry.</p>

<p>Public education, Mr. de Fellenberg
observes, is too generally a
uniform process, imposed indiscriminately,
and by force, upon every variety
of disposition, talents, and character.
His object, on the other hand,
is to suit the education to the pupil,
and not the pupil to the education.&mdash;A
good preceptor should be an experienced
friend, who guides,&mdash;not a
master who commands, and, above
all, not an irascible master. Punishments
and rewards he considers as
equally objectionable: for fear makes
slaves, and the love of distinction unfolds,
in the end, most of the bad passions.
<em>Do as you would be done by</em>
is, he maintains, the only safe rule of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
conduct to inculcate; a lively feeling
of right and wrong, goodwill and
kindness to all men, the only sentiments
fit to be encouraged. Emulation,
perhaps, is too powerful and
universal a stimulant to be altogether
excluded; but it needs more frequently
to be repressed than excited.
Such a vigilant and cautious system
of training would be best carried on
certainly under the parental roof, in a
well regulated and united family;
and therefore he wishes a school to
resemble as nearly as possible such a
family, and to be as unlike as possible
to a mere manufactory of learning.</p>

<p>The whole course of studies may
be considered as divided into three
periods, of three years each. In the
first, they study Greek and the Grecian
History, the knowledge of animals,
plants, and minerals. In the
second, Latin, Roman History, and
the Geography of the Roman world.
And in the third, Modern Languages
and Literature, Modern History to
the last century, and Geography&mdash;the
Physical Sciences, and Chymistry.
During the whole nine years,
they apply to Mathematics, Drawing,
Music, and Gymnastic Exercises.</p>

<p>The geometrical representation of
near objects&mdash;the house, the garden,
the course of the river, the surrounding
country, the mountains beyond it,
taken by approximation in the shape
of a map&mdash;is the natural introduction
to Geography. When the pupils feel
a curiosity to know more of the world
than they can see, maps are then laid
before them, and the globe and its
uses are explained. They are made
to delineate correctly, from memory,
the shape of continents and seas; and
to place and name the principal chains
of mountains, the course of rivers, the
boundaries of states, their provinces
and capitals;&mdash;and this leads to an
inquiry into the particular history of
each, and their natural productions.</p>

<p>Drawing is early cultivated, from
natural objects first, then by copying,
and finally by composing characteristic
heads, or rather endeavouring to
imitate the effect of passions on the
human countenance. The execution
is generally correct, but hard and dry&mdash;in
the style of Perugino certainly,
rather than of Rembrandt. Music
likewise is much practised; not however
with a view to execution, but for
the sake of the Poetry of music, and
its Piety&mdash;as an elevated language,
in which certain ideas and feelings are
expressed, which no other human
means can reach or convey. The
gymnastic exercises have for their
object, health, and the dexterous use
of the bodily faculties; but they never
are exhibited in public, and made
an occasion of show and display.</p>

<p>It is the endeavour of the master
to encourage his pupils to express
freely, both in writing and conversation,
the opinions and feelings which
have been suggested by their reading;
and thus to enable them to rectify
their mistakes, either as to facts or
inferences; never dictating to them
what they should think, and yet restraining
and directing the flights of
a young imagination. The pupils do
not read the history of the last century
before their twentieth year, when
judgment is sufficiently matured;
and even then, all reference to the
politics of the day is avoided, that
they may enter the world with minds
wholly free from party spirit, and able
to form unprejudiced opinions. Common
newspapers and political pamphlets
are never seen at Hofwyl.</p>

<p>The study of Mathematics continues
during the whole period of education,
to an extent determined entirely
by the individual capacity and
disposition of each pupil, who is not
hurried on or retarded for the sake of
keeping pace with others. Every
problem is analyzed and explained
thoroughly before passing to another.
The interest and attention of those of
ordinary abilities, is kept up by practical
applications of the science; and
none but those properly qualified apply
to the pure mathematics: In doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
so, they are carefully guarded
against the pride of successful calculation,
which is apt to overlook Divine
power in the consideration of its own.</p>

<p>At the same time that Mr. de Fellenberg
dwells with delight and confidence
on the natural proofs of the
existence of the Supreme Being, he
admits fully, and establishes the necessity
of a Revelation to supply the
insufficiency of human reason. Socrates
himself, he observes, did not
know how to establish the dogma of
the unity of God. His pupils, brought
up in purity and simplicity of heart,
under the influence of reason and
kindness, are in a great degree Christians
before they are taught Christianity,&mdash;and
best prepared, therefore,
to understand and receive the Divine
doctrine; but all dogmatic points are
reserved for the ministers of their respective
communions, who are to instruct
them; and controversial disputes
are unknown and interdicted.</p>

<p>It has been said also that Mr. de
Fellenberg's husbandry is ruinous.
This would only add to the wonder
of his being able to do what he does
by his own slender means; but, in
point of fact, his farm affords a very
considerable profit. We have, upon
this point, the evidence of a gentleman
well versed in those matters, Mr.
Crud of Genthod, one of the commissioners
appointed by the Swiss Diet
to inquire into the agricultural establishment
at Hofwyl, the result of
whose statements is, that the farm
(214<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> poses, equal to about 172
English acres) has produced <em>net</em> in 4
years from 1810 to 1814, 56,705<i>l.</i>
Swiss money, and for one year 14,176<i>l.</i>
which, deducting interest at 6 per
cent. on 14,382<i>l.</i> the average value
of stock on the farm, or 843<i>l.</i>, leaves
a clear profit of 13,313<i>l.</i>, equal to 3<i>l.</i>
17s. 6d. Sterling a pose (nearly equal
to <sup><small>4</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>5</small></sub>ths of an English acre;)<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and,
valuing the farm at the high price of
750<i>l.</i> a pose, (47<i>l.</i> Sterling,) gives
something more than 8<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> per cent.
interest, net of all charges. The farm
is undoubtedly benefited by the Institution,
which affords a ready market
for its produce, and perhaps by the
low price at which the labour of
Vehrli's boys is charged: But the
farm, on the other hand, affords regular
employment to the boys; and also
enables Mr. de Fellenberg to receive
his richer pupils at a lower price
than he could otherwise do. Hofwyl,
in short, is a great whole; where 120
or 130 pupils, more than 50 masters
and professors, as many servants, and
a number of day-labourers, six or
eight families of artificers and tradesmen,
altogether about 300 persons,
find a plentiful, and in many respects
a luxurious subsistence, exclusive of
education, out of the produce of 170
acres, and a money income of six or
seven thousand pounds, reduced more
than half by salaries, affords a very
considerable surplus to lay out in additional
buildings.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with what we had ourselves
learned and thought on this
subject, we have been anxious to learn
what was thought of it in the neighbourhood,
and by persons not particularly
friendly to the Institution.
We have scarcely heard an objection
against the <i>School of Industry</i>. The
opinion is <em>universally</em> favourable to
it; and though there is more difference
of sentiment as to the <em>higher
school</em>, the worst we have heard is,
that the pupils are not so advanced in
any one science as some young men
brought up in other schools are. It
is admitted that they are eminently
moral and amiable in their deportment;
that they are very intelligent;
and that their ideas have a wide range.
In short, the objection, as it appears
to us, is, that they are likely to become
liberal-minded gentlemen, but not
professors. Hofwyl is not a college
where the only object is learning;&mdash;still
less a monastery, where an austere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and uniform rule prevails;&mdash;it is
a little world, composed of different
ranks and professions, and where individuality
of character is preserved,
and a variety of talents unfolded.</p>

<p>The patricians of Berne have been
generally, from the beginning, unfavourable
to the Institution; yet several
of them have their sons in it, and
many more are now endeavouring to
procure admittance. We have learned
very lately, that a decided and active
enemy, many years first magistrate
of the district where Hofwyl is
situated, and lately dead, enjoined expressly
in his last-will, that his sons
should, if possible, be educated exclusively
at Hofwyl!</p>

<h2><i>Treatise on Agriculture.</i></h2>

<h3>SECT. IV.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">Of the Analysis of Soils, and of the agricultural relations
between soils and plants.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have seen that the earths have
a threefold capacity; that they receive
and lodge the roots of plants and
support their stems; that they absorb
and hold air, water and mucilage&mdash;aliments
necessary to vegetable life;
and that they even yield a portion of
themselves to these aliments. But
we have also seen, that they are not
equally adapted to these offices; that
their parts, texture and qualities are
different; that they are cold or warm,
wet or dry, porous or compact, barren
or productive, in proportion as
one or other may predominate in the
soil; and that to fit them for discharging
the various functions to which they
are destined, each must contribute
its share, and all be minutely divided
and intimately mixed. In this great
work nature has performed her part,
but as is usual with her, she has wisely
and benevolently left something
for man to do.</p>

<p>This necessary march of human industry,
obviously begins by ascertaining
the <em>nature of the soil</em>. But neither
the touch, nor the eye, however practised
or acute, can in all cases determine
this. <em>Clay</em>, when wet, is cold
and tenacious&mdash;a description that belongs
also to magnesian earths: <em>sand</em>
and <em>gravel</em> are hard and granular;
but so also are some of the modifications
of lime: <em>vegetable mould</em> is
black and friable, but not exclusively
so; for schistous and carbonaceous
earths have the same properties.</p>

<p>It is here, then, that chemistry offers
herself to obviate difficulties, and
remove doubts; but neither the apparatus
nor process of this science,
are within the reach of all who are
interested in the inquiry, and we accordingly
subjoin a method, less comprehensive,
but more simple and sufficiently
exact, for agricultural purposes,
and which calls only for two
vases, a pair of scales, clean water
and a little sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>"1st. Take a small quantity of
earth from different parts of the field,
the soil of which you wish to ascertain,
mix them well together and
weigh them; put them in an oven,
heated for baking bread, and after
they are dried, weigh them again;
the difference will show the <em>absorbent
power of the earth</em>. When the loss
of weight in 400 grains, amounts to
50, this power is great, and indicates
the presence of much animal or vegetable
matter; but when it does not
exceed twenty, the absorbent power
is small, and the vegetable matter
deficient.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"2d. Put the dried mass into a
vase with one fourth of its own weight
of clear water; mix them well together:
pour off the dirty water into a
second vase, and pour on as much
clean water as before; stir the contents,
and continue this process until
the water poured off, is as clear as
that poured on the earth. What remains
in the first employed vase is
<em>sand</em>, <em>silicious</em> or <em>calcareous</em>.</p>

<p>"3d. The dirty water, collected
in the second vase, will form a deposit,
which (after pouring off the wa-ter)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
must be dried, weighed and <em>calcined</em>.
On weighing it <em>after</em> this process,
the quantity lost will show the
portion of <em>animal</em> and <em>vegetable mould
contained in the soil</em>; and,</p>

<p>"4th. This calcined matter must
then be carefully pulverised and
weighed, as also the first deposit of
sand, but without mixing them. To
these, apply (separately) sulphuric
acid, and what they respectively lose
in weight, is the portion of <em>calcareous</em>
or <em>aluminous earths</em> contained in
them. These last may be separated
from the mass by soap lie, which
dissolves them."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Here is the light we wanted. In
knowing the disease, we find the cure.
Clay and sand qualify each other;
either of these will correct an excess
of lime; and magnesian earth, when
saturated with <em>carbonic acid</em>, becomes
fertile.</p>

<p>But entirely to alter the constitution
of a soil, whether by mechanical
or other means, is a work of time,
labour and expense, and little adapted
to the pecuniary circumstances of
farmers in general. Fortunately, a
remedy, cheaper, more accessible and
less difficult, is found in that <em>great diversity</em>
of habits and character, which
mark the vegetable races. We shall,
therefore, in what remains of this
section, indicate the principal of these,
as furnishing the basis of all rational
agriculture.</p>

<p>1st. <i>Plants have different systems
of roots, stems and leaves, and adapt
themselves accordingly to different
kinds of soils:</i> the Tussilago prefers
clay, the Spergula sand; Asparagus
will not flourish on a bed of
granite nor Musus Islandicus on one
of alluvion. It is obvious, that <em>fibrous
rooted</em> plants, which occupy only the
surface of the earth, can subsist on
comparatively stiff and compact soils
in which those of the leguminous and
cruciform families would perish, from
inability to penetrate and divide.</p>

<p>2d. <i>Plans of the same, or of a similar
kind, do not follow each other
advantageously in the same soil.</i>
Every careful observer must have
seen how grasses alternate in meadows
or pastures, where nature is left
to herself. At one time, timothy, at
another clover, at a third red-top, and
at a fourth blue grass prevails. The
same remark applies to forest trees;
the original growth of wood, is rarely
succeeded by a second of the same
kind; pine is followed by oak, oak
by chesnut, chesnut by hickory. A
young apple tree will not live in a
place where an old one has died;
even the pear tree does not thrive in
succession to an apple tree, but stone
fruit will follow either with advantage.
"In the Gautinois (says Bosc,)
saffron is not resumed but after a
lapse of twenty years; and in the
Netherlands, flax and colzat require
an interval of six years. Peas, when
they follow beans, give a lighter
crop than when they succeed plants
of another family."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>3d. <i>Vegetables, whether of the name
family or not, having a similar structure
of roots, should not succeed each
other.</i> It has been observed, that
trees suffer considerably by the neighbourhood
of sainfoin and lucern, on
account of the great depth to which
the roots of these plants penetrate&mdash;whereas
culmiferous grasses do them
no harm.</p>

<p>4th. <i>Annual or biennial trefoils,
prevent the escape of moisture by evaporation,
or filtration, from sandy and
arid soils</i>, and should constantly cover
them in the absence of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
plants;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> while <em>drying and dividing
crops</em>, as beans, cabbages, chickory,
&amp;c. &amp;c. <em>are best fitted to correct
the faults of stiff and wet clays</em>.</p>

<p>5th. <i>When plants, are cultivated in
rows or hills, and the ground between
them is thoroughly worked, the earth
is kept open, divided and permeable
to air, heat and water, and accordingly
receives from the atmosphere nearly
as much alimentary provision as it
gives to the plant.</i> This principle is
the basis of the drill husbandry.</p>

<p>6th. <i>All plants permitted to go
through the phases of vegetation (and
of course to give their seeds) exhaust
the ground in a greater or less degree;
but if cut green, and before seeding,
they take little from the principle of
fertility.</i></p>

<p>7th. <i>Plants are exhausters in proportion
to the length of time they occupy
the soil.</i> Those of the culmiferous
kinds (wheat, rye, &amp;c.) do not
ripen under ten months, and during
this period, forbid the earth from being
stirred: while, on the other hand,
leguminous plants occupy it but six
months, and permit frequent ploughings.
This is one reason why culmiferous
crops are greater exhausters than
leguminous; another is, that the stems
of culmiferous plants become hard and
flinty, and their leaves dry and yellow,
from the time of flowering till the ripening
of the seed&mdash;losing their inhaling
or absorbing faculties&mdash;circulating
no juices, and living altogether
in their roots, and on aliments exclusively
derived from the earth, whereas
leguminous or cruciferous plants, as
cabbages, turnips, &amp;c. &amp;c. have succulent
stems, and broad and porous
leaves, and draw their principal nourishment
from the atmosphere. The
remains of culmiferous crops, also
are fewer, and less easily decomposed,
than those of the leguminous family.</p>

<p>8th. <i>Meadows, natural and artificial,
yield the food necessary to cattle,
and, in proportion as these are multiplied,
manures are increased and the
soil made better.</i> Another circumstance
that recommends them is, that
so long as they last, they exact but little
labour, and leave the whole force of
the farmer to be directed to his arable
grounds.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>9th. <i>Grasses are either fibrous or
tap-rooted, or both. The remarks already
made in articles 1, 2 and 3, apply
also to them.</i> Timothy, red-top,
oat-grass and rye-grass, succeed best
in stiff, wet soils. Sainfoin does well
on soils the most bare, mountainous
and arid; lucern and the trefoils, (or
clovers,) only attain the perfection of
which they are susceptible, in warm,
dry, calcareous earth.</p>

<p>10th. <i>The ameliorating quality of
tap-rooted plants is supposed to be in
proportion to their natural duration</i>;
annual clover, (lupinella) has less of
this property than biennial, (Dutch
clover,) biennial less than sainfoin,
and sainfoin less than lucern.</p>

<p>11th. <i>Any green crop, ploughed
into the soil, has an effect highly improving</i>;
but for this purpose, lupins
and buckwheat (cut when in flower)
are most proper.</p>

<p>12. <i>Mixed crops</i> (as Indian corn,
pumpkins, and peas and oats,) <i>are
much and profitably employed</i>, and
<i>with less injury to the soil than either
corn or oats alone</i>.</p>

<h3>SECTION V.</h3>

<p class="center">Of Practical Agriculture, and its necessary Instruments.</p>


<p>We begin this part of our subject
with a few remarks on the instruments
necessary to agriculture, which may
be comprised under the well known
names of the plough, the harrow, the
roller, the threshing-machine, and the
fanning mill.</p>

<p>I. Of the plough:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>It is among the inscrutable dispensations
of Providence, that the arts
most useful to man, have been of later
discovery&mdash;of slower growth, and of
less marked improvement, than those
that aimed only at his destruction.&mdash;At
a time, when the phalanx and the
legions were invented and perfected,
and when the instruments they employed
were various and powerful,
those of agriculture continued to be
few, and simple, and inefficient.</p>

<p>Of the Greek plough, we know
nothing; and the general disuse of
that described by Virgil and Pliny,
furnishes a degree of evidence, that
experience has found it incompetent
to its objects.&mdash;With even the boasted
lights of modern knowledge, scientific
men are not agreed upon the
form and proportion, most proper for
this instrument. As in other cases,
so in this, there may be no <em>abstract
perfection</em>; what is best in one description
of soil, may not be so in another;
yet, as in all soils, the office of the
plough is the same, viz. to <em>cleave</em> and
<em>turn over the earth</em>, there cannot but
be some definite shape and proportions,
better fitted for these purposes,
and at the same time less susceptible
of resistance, than any other.</p>

<p>This beau ideal, this suppositious
excellence, in the mechanism of a
plough, has been the object of great
national, as well as individual research.
In Great Britain, high prizes have
been established for its attainment;
and in France, under the ministry of
Chaptal, 10,000 francs, or $2000,
were offered for this object, by the
agricultural society of the Seine. In
both countries, the subject has employed
many able pens; those of
Lord Kaimes, of Mr. Young, of Mr.
Arbuthnot, of Lord Somerville, and
of Messieurs Duhamel, Chateauvieux,
Bosc, Guillaume, &amp;c. It is not
for us, therefore, to do more than assemble
and present such rules for the
construction of this instrument, as
have most attained the authority of
maxims.</p>

<p>1st. The beam, or that part of the
plough which carries the coulter, and
furnishes the point of draft, should be
as near that of resistance as possible;
because the more these are approached,
the less is the moving power required.
Even the shape of the beam
is not a matter of indifference. In
the old ploughs, it was generally
straight, but a small curve is now
preferred; because it has the effect
of strengthening the coulter, by shortening
it.</p>

<p>2d. The <em>head</em> of the plough, is the
plain on which it moves. This should
be concave, because that form offers
fewer points of friction, and, of course,
less resistance. Between the beam
and the head, is an angle, on which
depends the principal office of the
plough; the making, at will, a deep
or a shallow furrow. If you wish a
deep furrow, diminish the angle, and
vice versa: but this angle should, in
no case, exceed from 18 to 24 degrees.</p>

<p>The resistance made to the plough
being produced less by the weight of
the earth, than by the cohesion of its
parts, it is evident, that the head
should be shod with iron, and rendered
as smooth as possible. This remark
applies equally to the soc and
to the mould board.</p>

<p>3d. The soc, in its widest part,
should be larger than the head. It
has different shapes in different countries.
In some is given to it that of
an isosceles triangle; in others, that of
the head of a lance; in Biscay, that
of a crescent; and in Poland, of a two
pronged fork. But, whatever be its
shape, it should be well pointed and
polished&mdash;enter the earth with facility,
and cut it easily.</p>

<p>4th. To the <em>mould board</em>, some
workmen give the shape of a prismatic
wedge; others make the upper
part convex, and the lower concave;
while many make it entirely flat. In
stiff soils, the <em>semi cycloid</em> is the form
to be preferred, and in loose friable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
soils the <em>semi-ellipsis</em>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The iron
mould boards have great advantages
over the wooden, particularly when
they, the shear and the soc, form one
piece, as in the plough of Mr. Cook.</p>

<p>It is a general opinion, that a heavy
plough is more disadvantageous than
a light one; because the draft of the
former, being greater, will be more
fatiguing to the cattle: but the experiments
of the agricultural society in
London, establish a contrary doctrine,
and show, that in light grounds, the
labour is more easily and better performed,
with a heavy, than with a
light plough.</p>

<p>5th. The <em>coulter</em> is a species of
knife inserted in the beam, and so
placed before the soc, as to cut the
sod. It is susceptible of being raised
or depressed at will.</p>

<p>6th. The handles of the plough
ought to be made of some kind of
heavy wood, that they may operate
as a counter-weight to the head, the
soc and the mould-board.</p>

<p>To these remarks we subjoin two
sets of experiments made with the
most approved French and English
ploughs; that of Guillaume, and
Small's <i>Rotheram plough improved</i>,
which furnish a means of comparison
between the best ploughs of Europe
and those of this country.</p>

<p>The resistance (stated in these tables)
was measured and ascertained
by a <em>dynonometer</em>, a machine, indispensable
to those who would make
correct observations on the relative
advantages of different ploughs.</p>

<p>II. <i>The Harrow.</i> This is of different
kinds&mdash;the triangular and the
square, the single and the double.
But of whatever form, its uses are
the same; to smooth the field after
ploughing, to break and pulverize
the clods, and to cover the seed.&mdash;These
uses sufficiently indicate the
propriety of employing two in succession;
one of heavy frame, with few
and long teeth, like the Scotch brake;
the other, of lighter constitution, with
more and shorter teeth. Our own
experience leads us to believe, that
the common harrow covers the seed
too much, because small seeds will
not vegetate at a depth greater than
three inches.</p>


<p>III. <i>The Roller</i> is a cylinder of
heavy wood, turning on gudgeons, or
on an axle, and placed in a frame, to
which is attached a shaft; it is of different
dimensions, but need not exceed
that which may be drawn by
one, or at most by two horses or oxen.
This instrument is indispensable in
good husbandry, yet is rarely used in
ours. Its offices are three-fold&mdash;to
render loose soils more compact; to
break the clod on stiff ones, and on
both, to compress the earth, (after
seeding) so that it be every where
brought in contact with the grain.
It is also usefully employed in reinstating
the roots of meadow grasses,
loosened and raised by the alternate
freezing and thawing of the ground,
and, with similar view, may be passed
over winter crops early in the spring.</p>

<p>Its clod-breaking and pulverizing
property is much increased, by surrounding
the roller with narrow bands
of iron, two inches broad, three inches
thick, and six inches asunder; or by
studding it with iron points, resembling
harrow teeth, and projecting
three or four inches.</p>


<p>IV. <i>The Threshing Machine</i> is of
English invention, and may be well
enough adapted to the taste and circumstances
of rich amateurs, but not
at all to those of farmers in general.
Our objections to it are three&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
first cost, which is great; the quantum
of moving power employed,
which is equal to that of six horses,
and the number of hands required to
attend it, which is not less than four.
We have seen, in France, a machine
for the same purpose, but of much
simpler structure&mdash;called the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rouleau
de depiquer</i>" which is only a
<em>fluted cylinder</em>; yet simple and cheap
as this was, it could not maintain itself
against the more ancient instruments&mdash;the
flail and the horse. Still it is
to be hoped, that new experiments
may succeed better and abridge the
manual labour usually given to this
branch of husbandry, and, that the
mechanical genius of our own country
(which is not inferior to that of
any other) may be the first to combine
<em>power</em> and <em>cheapness</em> in this machine.</p>

<p>This hope is probably suggested,
by the description of a new invented
threshing machine, now before me,
and which I may be permitted to
transcribe from the letter of the inventor.
"The machine I have built, is
three feet wide. One horse will thresh
with much ease, as much wheat
as can be laid on it, by one man, (the
straw to be taken away by another,)
say, from <em>fifty</em> to <em>one hundred bushels
in a day</em>, and the saving of grain will
pay for the labour; for, I think, that
with good attendance, not a particle
of grain can escape with the straw.&mdash;The
expense of the machine will be
from <em>fifty</em> to <em>seventy dollars</em>, exclusive
of the moving power, which is a
wheel, about ten feet diameter, on an
upright shaft, to which a lever is fixed
to hitch the horse. Into this main
wheel, a small one should be made
to work, about two feet diameter, on
a shaft carrying a drum, four feet
wide. With this simple gearing, and
drawn by a horse that walks well, the
machine will give about eighteen
hundred strokes in a minute, and if
fully attended, will, without hard labour
for the horse, thresh a <em>bushel
every three</em> or <em>four minutes</em>. It stands
in my barn, and may be seen and examined
by any one."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>


<p>V. <i>The Fanning Mill</i>. Other
things being equal, the cleanest wheat
is most easily preserved, and, on manufacture,
gives the best flour, and in
the largest quantity. These considerations
offer inducement enough for
the employment of this machine,
which, however, besides doing its business
well, saves a great deal of time.
It is too well known to require description.</p>

<h2>ON BONES, &amp;c. AS MANURE.</h2>


<p>The carbon and hydrogen abounding
in oily substances fully account
for their effects; and their durability
is explained from the gradual manner
in which they change by the action
of air and water.</p>

<p><em>Bones</em> are much used as a manure
in the neighbourhood of London.&mdash;After
being broken and boiled for
grease, they are sold to the farmer.
The more divided they are, the more
powerful are their effects. The expense
of grinding them in a mill
would probably be repaid by the increase
of their fertilizing powers;
and in the state of powder they might
be used in the drill husbandry, and
delivered with the seed in the same
manner as rape cake.</p>

<p>Bone dust, and bone shavings, the
refuse of the turning manufacture,
may be advantageously employed in
the same way.</p>

<p>The basis of bone is constituted by
earthy salts, principally phosphate of
lime, with some carbonate of lime
and phosphate of magnesia; the easily
decomposed substances in bone
are fat, gelatine and cartilage, which
seems of the same nature as coagulated
albumen.</p>

<p>According to the analysis of Fourcroy
and Vauquelin ox bones are
composed</p>

<p>The remaining parts of the 100
must be considered as decomposable
animal matter.</p>

<p><em>Horn</em> is a still more powerful manure
than bone, as it contains a larger
quantity of decomposable animal matter.
From 500 grains of ox-horn,
Mr. Hatchett obtained only 1-5 grains
of earthy residuum, and not quite half
of this was phosphate of lime. The
shaving or turnings of horn form an
excellent manure, though they are
not sufficiently abundant to be in common
use. The animal matter in them
seems to be of the nature of coagulated
albumen, and it is slowly rendered
soluble by the action of water.
The earthy matter in horn and still
more that in bones, prevents the too
rapid decomposition of the animal
matter, and renders it very durable in
its effects.</p>

<h2>FRENCH AGRICULTURE.</h2>


<p>The Moniteur contains a very long
report by Decaze, which is published,
as having been approved of by the
king on the state of agriculture in
France. It appears from this document
that the fostering care of the
government is steadily, and in most
instances, successfully, exercised in
promoting every branch of cultivation
adapted to the French soil and climate.
One branch, that of the culture
of the beet root, which it was
supposed would have languished on
the restoration of the sugar colonies,
is stated to be gradually but firmly
extending itself, and its encouragement
is recommended to the government,
among other considerations, on
the special ground on which it was
originally introduced, that of rendering
France independent of foreign
supplies of sugar in a period of war.
It has been affirmed, that those who
manufacture into sugar beet root,
raised on their own farms, realized a
profit of 25 per cent.; and on the
supposition that a quantity were raised
adequate to supply the total consumption
of sugar in France, it is said that
the refuse of the beet root would of
itself suffice to fatten for the market
annually 120,000 head of cattle.&mdash;There
are now about twenty beet
root sugar refineries in full activity.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Georgetown</span>, (S.C.) April 20.</h2>

<p><i>An Agricultural Prize worth winning.</i>&mdash;We
are informed by a gentleman
from Stateburg, that fourteen or
more members of the Claremont
Agricultural Society, of that neighbourhood,
have agreed to plant, each
an acre of ground in corn, to be manured
and cultivated at pleasure.&mdash;The
planter producing the most neat
corn to the acre, (as a reward for his
superiour farming) is to receive the
produce of every other acre. The
land to be planted must be high land,
and have been cleared at least five
years. A committee of five members
were appointed to approve of
the land, to superintend the gathering
and measuring the corn, and to report
to the Society at its meeting in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
fall, when we will be able to inform
our readers of the successful planter,
and the neat product of each acre.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ON THE CULTURE OF THE SUGAR
MAPLE.</h2>


<p>This valuable tree seems to be
equally well adapted for ornament
and for profit. No tree, of the deciduous
class, is more elegant in appearance,
and but few grow more rapidly,
or live to a greater length of
years. Its shade is but little injurious
to the growths of grain, and still less
to those of grass. For fuel it is inferiour
to no wood whatever. It may
be cultivated in mowing and pasture
lands, probably as closely as at the
rate of 20 trees on an acre, without
any essential injury to the pasture, or
growth of the meadow. The quantity
of sugar to be made yearly from
the sap of the tree must, however,
depend on its size, and on the rapidity
of its growth. The quicker its
growth, the more sap may be extracted
from it, because the alburnum
(sap wood) is always in the greatest
proportion where the tree is most
flourishing.</p>

<p>The rapidity of the growth of
young trees, when transplanted, depends
very essentially on the manner
of performing that operation. The
greater the depth and superficial extent,
to which the ground is loosened,
round where a young tree is to be
set, the more rapid will be its growth
when placed in this bed of loosened
earth. Let one young tree, for instance,
be set in a hole dug only 18
inches in diameter, and a foot in
depth, and let another be set in a
hole dug 6 feet wide, and 2 feet deep,
and the latter will, for a number of
succeeding years, grow with more
than double the rapidity of the former.
In order, then, to give the
young maples a rapid start, so as to
have them soon fitted for affording
considerable supplies of sap, let due
attention be paid to this particular.
Let the holes for the trees be dug,
say, a foot in depth, and five in diameter,
and then spade or loosen the
ground at the bottoms to the depth of
8 or 10 inches more before the young
trees are to be set in.</p>

<p>In addition to planting maples in
grounds intended as permanent pastures,
and mowing grounds, each side
of the highway, leading through any
farm, might be profitably occupied
and adorned with these trees, set at
the distance of about every two rods.
Suppose also that the farm house
were placed in a spacious court yard,
say of an acre in extent, and this
planted with a suitable number of
maples, could any thing confer more
of an air of pleasantness and elegance
to the mansion?</p>

<p>I shall not attempt any computation
of the probable profits to be derived
from this proposed improvement
in rural affairs, but doubtless
the gain would be very considerable.
Every farmer might, in this way,
stock his lands with a permanent
growth that would afford him a plentiful
supply of sugar, that would at
times afford him additions of fuel,
and that would eminently serve as an
embellishment of his domain, and all
these essential advantages would be
derived without any essential diminution
of the usual products of his
lands.</p>

<p>It is probable that if the young
trees be planted in the manner just
mentioned, they would attain a size
fit for tapping in about 15 years, after
which they would probably afford yearly
supplies of sap for more than a century,
if tapped in the manner least
calculated to injure them. This is to
be performed, not by cutting large
gashes in them with an axe, but by
boring one or more holes in them,
with a small auger, to the depth of
about 3 inches, or at all events not
beyond the extent of the sap wood.
The holes should be made every year
in different parts of the trees, sometimes
higher and sometimes lower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and after the sap has ceased running
for the season, they should be filled
with pieces of durable wood, drove
in, in order that the wounds may be
soon healed over by the subsequent
growth of the trees.</p>

<h2>FLEMISH HUSBANDRY.</h2>

<p class="center">From the Plough Boy.</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;Much has been said in praise
of English husbandry, though it is a
well known fact, that this vaunted
system is surpassed in many countries
which do not possess equal natural
advantages. In Scotland, agriculture
has progressed at least half
a century beyond that of England,
where the soil and climate is far more
congenial to the productions of the
earth than the "bleak mountains of
Caledonia." But no where in the
world is the contrast so marked as
that between the Flemish and English
mode of cultivation.</p>

<p>The average produce of a crop of
wheat, in England, is 24 bushels per
acre. In Flanders, it is 32 bushels.
In England, the system of <em>fallows</em> almost
universally prevails. In Flanders,
it has been unknown from time
immemorial; two crops, in many
cases three, being uniformly raised
annually upon the same field. The
following comparative tables, as exhibited
in "Vanderstracten's sketch
of the Flemish system," shew clearly
and correctly its superior advantages
over that of England.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Flemish system">

</table></div>

<p>This immense difference in favour
of the produce of Flanders, does not
arise, as might be supposed, from its
possessing a better natural soil, or a
milder climate, than England; but
entirely from the different mode of
cultivation pursued in these two countries.
At no very distant period, the
fields of Flanders, now so productive,
were little else but loose sand and
gravel, whereas the soil of England,
was always naturally fertile, and in
part, lies under a more southerly parallel
than Flanders.</p>

<p>The rich, abundant, and healthy
crops obtained by the Flemish farmers,
may be traced to the following
causes:</p>

<p>I. The abundance and judicious application
of manure. II. Digging all
the lands on their farms with the
spade, every six or every three years.
III. The complete extirpation of
weeds and noxious roots. IV. Regular
and repeated hoeing. V. A
careful choice, and alternation, of
grain and seeds for sowing. VI. An
improved rotation of crops.</p>

<p>"The whole secret (observes Vanderstracten)
respecting the superiority
of Flemish agriculture, consists
in this; the farmers procure plenty
of food for their cattle&mdash;food which,
excepting clover, is raised from the
same lands which have already yielded
their crops of grain, &amp;c. They
keep the greatest possible number of
cattle, feed them in the stables plentifully,
and render their food palatable.
They collect the greatest possible
quantity of manure, of which
they preserve the fertilizing salts by
a suitable process of fermentation.&mdash;They
weed their grounds thoroughly
and repeatedly. They totally extirpate
noxious plants and roots, every
six or every three years, by digging
all the lands on their respective farms&mdash;an
operation by which they revert
to the surface a stratum of fresh soil,
that for three or for six years has
been absorbing the salts of manure
as they filtrated to the bottom of the
roots: a stratum of soil which has
produced no crop during the same
period. They, moreover, dress their
grounds to the precise point of perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
pulverization. These are inestimable
advantages, which cannot be
obtained by any plough whatever;
hence the drift of the Flemish adage&mdash;"Never
to let the naked ground
lie open to the sun in summer for
more than three days."</p>

<p>"In truth, to say that there exists
a vast province, in which the price of
lands has been quadrupled within fifty
years, and which is neither placed
under a more favourable climate, nor
enjoys a greater fertility of soil, than
England; from which fallows in general
have been banished from time immemorial;
in which the greater part
of the lands produce in 9 years at
least 15 harvests, of which those of
grain yield, one year with another, as
high as 32 bushels of wheat per acre;
those of barley, 60 bushels; and those
of oats, 90 bushels; and where the
borders of the fields are planted with
trees, in such numbers, that by their
sale the proprietors acquire, every 40
years, a sum of money equal to the
soil; to say this, appears, to other
than English readers, to repeat a tissue
of fables.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The less informed attribute
this uninterrupted succession
of harvests to the inexhaustible fertility
of the soil; but intelligent and
well-informed travellers attribute it,
on the contrary, and with the best
reason, to the indefatigable industry
of the inhabitants, and to a highly improved
mode of culture, of the details
of which they themselves are ignorant,
and which beside, from their
complication, and the great variety of
the productions of the soil, require a
profound study, of many years duration,
to which few of them have either
the inclination or the leisure to
apply."</p>

<p>This correct, though "bird's eye"
view, of Flemish husbandry, merits
farther amplification, in order to furnish
distinct data to the intelligent
and enterprising agriculturist. My
subsequent communications will be
directed to that subject.</p>

<h2>LINCOLN CORN POUNDER.</h2>


<p>The usual mode of feeding Indian
corn to cattle and hogs, is wasteful
in the extreme. The cob is not eaten,
and the corn is neither ground nor
boiled. It is a well established physiological
fact, that the good health
of animals requires, that the aliments
for the stomach should afford both
nutriment and mechanical distention
in due proportions. In the usual method
of feeding, these proportions do
not exist, and besides the nutritious
quality is only partially extracted.
The grinding of corn is sometimes
practised by those who have mills,
and boiling by those who have not.
Meal is sometimes mixed with hot
water and fermented. All these are
improvements in feeding, but these
are not sufficient. Lately, a mill of
cast iron has been invented, which
converts both corn and cob into meal,
and is used also by tanners in grinding
their bark. This improvement is valuable.
The cob, while it affords in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
itself much nutriment, furnishes a
degree of distension to the stomach,
which is necessary to its proper action.
If to this grinding of the cob
and grain is superadded fermentation,
or boiling, the economical process is
nearly complete. I have not time to
say what the subject requires in regard
to fermentation. Boiling not
only renders the articles acted on soluble
in the stomach, but it does more&mdash;it
adds nutriment furnished by the
water itself. The experiments of
Count Rumford are full and satisfactory
on this head. Let those who
doubt the nutritive qualities of water
be reminded that many kinds of fish
live, grow and fatten in pure water,
without any other food whatever.&mdash;-Every
one has seen the gold fish,
which have lived for years in globes
of pure water, that are sometimes
put by the curious into cages of canary
birds. Water and air constitute
the entire aliment of vegetables, and
give them bulk without diminishing at
all the quantity of soil in which
they grow. The perfection of feeding
corn consists in preserving the
cob, grinding the whole into meal,
and in the cookery. The iron mill is
excellent, but too expensive for most
farmers. What is wanting, then, is
to have the corn, with its cob, powdered
by some cheap and simple method,
that every one may avail themselves
of. Such a one, accident lately
made me acquainted with; and I
think it is so valuable that I am desirous
of seeing it introduced into general
use, and shall attempt a description
of the machine by which the
process was effected.</p>

<p>This machine I saw last summer
in operation, on the road between
Lincolnton and Morgantown. It was
a horizontal shaft with a beater at one
end, poised by the weight of water
falling into an excavation at the other.
The shaft or helve was about fourteen,
possibly sixteen feet long. At
two thirds of its length from the beater,
it rested by a notch across the
sharpened edge of a piece of timber
lying in a transverse direction, serving
as a pivot or fulcrum for the shaft
to move on. The beater was a piece
of wood two feet, or rather more, in
length, fixed by a mortice and tennon
to the end of the shaft; its face was
about two inches and a half in diameter,
and plated with iron. The mortar
which received this pestal, or beater,
was the hollowed end of a log, wide
at top, narrower at bottom, and would
contain nearly a bushel. The other,
or shorter end of the shaft, was excavated
into a trough about three feet
long, eight inches wide, and the same
in depth. The extreme inner end of
the trough formed an angle of ascent
from the line of the bottom of about
35 degrees, affording thereby an easy
exit to the water when depressed by
its weight. This very simple machine,
for I have described the whole
of it, was placed upon the small run
of a spring branch, where there was
a descent of about two feet. The
water was conveyed into the trough
by a spout which approached it at
right angles, and the trough was filled
and discharged about twice in a minute.
Every morning, and again at
evening, this mortar was filled with
ears of corn, which in twelve hours
were found reduced to a very fine
meal. It was capable of converting
to meal three or four mortars full in
a day, but two were sufficient for the
use of the plantation, and the mortar
was attended to only when it could be
done with convenience. In a wet
season, when the spring run afforded
more water, it moved with increased
celerity, and was capable of increased
work. The machine was without cover,
and I observed barn-door fowls
around it, but afraid of the motion of
the shaft, they never ventured to purloin
from the mortar. The whole expense
of this, I think, could not have
exceeded four or five dollars.</p>

<p>I know not the inventor of this machine.
There were a few others, I
was told, in Lincoln and Burke. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
extreme simplicity, cheapness and
utility, and the means afforded to almost
every one of putting it in motion,
ought to recommend it to general use.
I am persuaded this method of pounding
corn, united to boiling or fermentation,
would double the value of crops
for feeding. No rule is necessary to
be observed with regard to the dimensions,
or proportions of the machine.
It must duly be noticed that the trough
filled with water is heavy enough to
raise the bearer; and this can be ascertained,
and the proportions duly
adjusted by experiment.&mdash;&mdash;If Mr.
Henderson think but half as favourably
of this machine as I do, he will
give the foregoing a place in his useful
paper.</p>

<h2>TRANSACTIONS OF THE HORTICULTURAL
SOCIETY OF LONDON.</h2>


<p><i>An improved method of cultivating
the Alpine Strawberry.</i>&mdash;&mdash;The strawberry
is a fruit which is agreeable to
the palate of so many persons, and
which disagrees with the constitution
of so few, that any means of improving
the culture of it, and of prolonging
the season of its maturity and perfection,
will be acceptable to the
Horticultural Society: I am therefore
induced to send an account of an
improved method of cultivating the
<i>Alpine Strawberry</i>, that is, I believe,
little if at all known, and that I have
practised with the best possible success.</p>

<p>Though the flavour of the Alpine
varieties is generally approved, they
are not much thought of while the
larger varieties continue in perfection,
and are valued only as an autumnal
crop. I was therefore led to try
several different methods of culture,
with a view to obtain plants that would
just begin to blossom when the other
varieties cease; conceiving that such
plants, not having expended either
themselves, or the virtue of the soil,
in a previous crop of fruit, would afford
the best and most abundant autumnal
produce. Under this impression,
I sowed the seeds of the best
Alpine variety that I had ever been
able to obtain, in pots of mould, in
the beginning of August, the seeds of
the preceding year having been preserved
to that period; and the plants
these afforded were placed, in the
end of March, in beds to produce
fruit. This experiment succeeded
tolerably well; but I was not quite
satisfied with it; for though my plants
produced an abundant autumnal crop
of fruit, they began to blossom somewhat
earlier than I wished, and before
they were perfectly well rooted in the
soil. I therefore tried the experiment
of sowing some seeds of the
same variety early in the spring, in
pots which I placed in a hotbed of
moderate strength in the beginning
of April, and the plants thus raised
were removed to the beds in which
they were to remain in the open
ground as soon as they had acquired
a sufficient size. They began to blossom
soon after midsummer, and to
ripen their fruit towards the end of
July, affording a most abundant crop
of very fine fruit. The powers of
life in plants thus raised, being young
and energetic, operate much more
powerfully than in the runners of
older plants, or even in plants raised
from seeds in the preceding year;
and therefore I think the Alpine
strawberry ought always to be treated
as an annual plant.</p>

<h2>OILING FRUIT TREES.</h2>


<p>Sir George M'Kenzie has discovered
that oil rubbed upon the stems
and branches of fruit trees destroys
insects, and increases the fruit buds.
Mr. John Linning has added to the
discovery, by using it successfully
upon the stems of carnations, to guard
them against the depredations of the
ear-wig. The coarsest oil will suit,
and only a small quantity is required.</p>

<h2>CULTURE OF FOREST TREES.</h2>


<p>Sir Watkin Williams Wynn has
planted within the last 5 years, in the
mountainous lands in the vicinity of
Langollen, situated from 12,000 to
14,000 feet above the level of the sea,
39,000 oaks, 63,000 Spanish chesnuts,
102,000 spruce firs, 110,000 Scotch
firs, 90,000 larches, 30,000 wych elms,
35,000 mountain elms, 80,000 ash, and
40,000 sycamores, all of which are
at this time, in a healthy and thriving
condition.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>TO PREVENT DECAY IN TREES.</h2>


<p>When old chesnut or other trees
are rotted within the trunk, and threaten
with speedy destruction by the
progress of the carious taint, it may
be stopped by applying fire to the decayed
part, so as to <em>char</em> the whole of
the neighbouring surfaces. By this
management the life of a favourite
tree may often be preserved.</p>

<h2>ON PLASTER.</h2>


<p>I have just received my <em>plaster</em>
from the mill. I remarked to the
man who brought it, that it was too
coarse. He replied that all our farmers
preferred it coarse, and assigned
this reason&mdash;that in grinding it fine,
<em>it becomes so heated as to injure it</em>.
I delay not a moment in expostulating
against a doctrine so unphilosophical,
and so injurious to the interests
of agriculture. Every farmer knows
that <em>grain</em>, as <em>food</em> for <em>animals</em> cannot
be made too fine. Upon the same
principle, <em>plaster</em>, which is <em>food</em> for
<em>vegetables</em>, affords the most nutriment
when reduced to the finest powder.
<em>Heat</em> so far from injuring the
properties of plaster, is the best agent
for bringing them into action. This
theory is the result of repeated experiment.
Calcined plaster, which is
produced by a process of <em>intense heat</em>,
is found much more invigorating, and
more permanently beneficial, than
plaster in its simple state.</p>

<p>While on this subject, I will suggest
for consideration, whether our
farmers, generally spread a sufficient
quantity of plaster particularly on
their grass land. Mr. Silas Gates, a
well known farmer in Marlborough,
informed me, that he directed one of
his men to spread on a certain piece
of mowing land, the usual quantity,
(if I mistake not, at the rate of one
bushel to the acre.) He had gone
over about half the ground, at this
rate, when other calls prevented his
finishing it. Soon after the business
of plastering was consigned to another,
who, not knowing that any had
been spread, went over the ground,
giving one half a double portion.&mdash;The
result was nearly a double portion
of hay, which continued until the
surface was changed by a rotation of
crops.</p>

<h2>CATERPILLARS.</h2>


<p>Farmers who are in the habit of
<em>rearing</em> <span class="smcap">CATERPILLARS</span>, for <em>ornament</em>
and <em>use</em>, will doubtless be gratified
to learn, that the late favourable weather
has produced a goodly show of
their favourite vermin. They are already
basking in the sun, and expanding
by the nutricious aliment of foliage
and fruit buds; and if not prematurely
molested, (which there is little
reason to apprehend) we may, in due
time, taste from our kneading troughs
the former repasts of Egypt.</p>

<p>Judging from the produce of last
year, it may be fairly calculated that
many of our farmers, (and some who
<em>do not belong to the Agricultural Society</em>)
will, this year, raise double as
many bushels of <em>caterpillars</em> as of <em>apples</em>.
Those (and there are some,)
who prefer the appearance and flavour
of the latter, will do well to
look to their trees immediately. A
thimble full of these reptiles, which
can now be destroyed in an instant,
would fill a hat a month hence, and
would require tenfold the labour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
subdue them. Every farmer's common
sense will suggest the best method
of extirpation.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p><i>A method of taking the Honey
without destroying the Bees.</i>&mdash;The
common practice of killing the bees,
in order to obtain the honey, few can
witness without some little compunction;
and as there is a very simple
method of effecting the object without
any injury to this most interesting
little animal, (which, on the score of
interest, as well as humanity, claims
regard,) I beg leave to communicate
it through your paper, should you
deem it worthy a place in it.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the bees have
retired, take the hive gently from the
stand; spread a table cloth on the
ground; set the hive on it, placing
something under to raise it three or
four inches; then draw up the corners
of the cloth, and fasten them
tight around the middle of the hive,
leaving it so loose below, that the
bees will have sufficient room between
it and the hive&mdash;then raise the lid of
the hive a little, and blow in the smoke
from a segar; a few puffs of which,
as it is very disagreeable, will drive
them down: continue raising the lid
gradually, blowing in the smoke all
around, and in a few minutes it will
be found that they have all gone out
of the hive. You may then take off
the lid, and cut away as much of the
honey as you may think proper. If
the operation be performed the beginning
of July, you may take nearly
all, as there will be time enough to
provide a sufficiency for their support
during the winter. As soon as you
have taken the honey, put on the lid,
loosen the cloth, and spread it out,
and in an hour or two the bees will
have returned into the hive. It may
then be replaced on the stand, and on
the following day they will be found
at work as usual.</p>

<p>This method is very simple, and
preferable to that sometimes practised,
of driving the bees into another
hive; as you get all the honey,
and moreover the new comb, which
is still empty; and the young bees,
not yet out of the cells, are preserved.
There is also danger in driving, of
their not liking their new habitation,
and, in that case, of their sallying out
and making war on their neighbours.</p>

<p>The above method has frequently
been practised by myself and others,
and we have always found it to do
well.</p>

<p><i>Conversion of Rags into Sugar.</i>&mdash;We
find this is no joke. There is
in the <cite>Annales de Chemie</cite> a long and
very circumstantial account, from the
pen of M. Henry Braconnot, of Geneva,
of the whole process of this singular
discovery; and are now so well
satisfied there is nothing of "pleasantry"
in the matter, as at first sight
appeared to many, that, should we be
told to-morrow that, as linen may be
converted into its constituent principle,
sugar&mdash;(a piece of fine Irish linen
into a loaf of double refined!)&mdash;so
may wool be converted into its constituent
principle, fat&mdash;(an old threadbare
coat into a basin of fine gravy
soup!)&mdash;we shall be prepared to look
quite grave at the announcement.</p>

<p>"The conversion of wood into
sugar (says M. Braconnot) will, no
doubt, appear remarkable; and when
persons not familiar with chemical
speculations are told that a pound
weight of rags can be converted into
<em>more</em> than a pound of sugar, they may
regard the statement as a piece of
pleasantry, though nothing can be
more real."</p>

<p>The agent in making this wonderful
conversion is sulphuric acid, and
those to whom it may not be enough
to know that the thing can be done,
will find ample directions as to the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> in M. Braconnot's
Memoir. We shall content ourselves
here with one extract:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"I made these 359.2 gr. of sugary
matter (obtained from old cloth well
dried) into the consistency of sirup;
at the end of twenty-four hours it began
to crystallize; and some days
after, the whole was solidified into
a single mass of crystallized sugar,
which was pressed strongly between
several folds of old cloth; crystallized
a second time, this sugar was passably
pure; but, treated with <em>animal</em>
charcoal, it became of a shining
whiteness.&mdash;The crystals were in
spherical groupes, which appear to
be formed by the union of small diverging
and unequal plates. They
are fusible at the temperature of boiling
water. This sugar, of a fresh and
agreeable flavour, produced in the
mouth a slight sensation of coolness.
It dissolves in hot alcohol, and crystallizes
by cooling. Dissolved in water,
and mixed with a little yeast, it
fermented; the vinous liquor which
resulted, furnished alcohol by distillation.
Burned with potash, and its
charcoal washed with diluted nitric
acid, it yielded a fluid not troubled by
nitrate or barytes. It would be useless
to insist farther on the properties
of this sugar: it is evident that it is
perfectly identical with the sugar of
grapes or of starch."</p>

<h2>RUTA BAGA EXPERIMENTS.</h2>


<p>1819, July 27&mdash;Sowed three fourths
of an acre of Ruta Baga, in ground
prepared as follows, viz.&mdash;Stubble
turned in deep&mdash;harrowed fine&mdash;furrowed
deep at four feet distance&mdash;filled
the furrows with <em>earth burnt
ashes</em>, (burnt according to the plan
prescribed by Mr. Cobbett, in his
"Year's Residence,") which I covered
by turning a furrow over them
on each side; this formed a ridge
about eighteen inches broad at top,
which being smoothed a little with a
hoe, and a drill made along the middle
of it with the same instrument;
I then sowed the seed and covered it
with a hoe, from one to two inches
deep; it came up on the 7th of August.
When the roots were nearly a
fourth of an inch thick, I thinned them
to about a foot distance in the rows,
and kept them free from weeds by
two good ploughings and hoeings,
(they would have been the better for
a third) notwithstanding the unexpected
dry season;&mdash;the last of November,
many of them would measure
fifteen inches in circumference&mdash;I
left them to stand in the ground
all winter. I was off the state, from
the middle of December to the middle
of February; on my return at the
latter period, the snow had just disappeared,
when I found my turnips
had grown at least one fifth larger,
since I saw them in December; many
of them measuring six to seven
inches diameter. The latter part of
February was unusually warm for the
season. The tops began to grow rapidly,
but the severe cold nights of
the early part of March, first freezing,
and the warmth of the middle of
the day, as often thawing them; many
rotted in the ground&mdash;had they
been pulled when the warm weather
<em>commenced</em>, this would have been prevented.
They are the cheapest, and
with the exception of corn, they are
the best food for milch cows and hogs,
I ever met with&mdash;I have been feeding
mine upon them for the last 6 weeks.
Within a week past, I had them all
pulled, (except those left for seed,)
and thrown in heaps. Should the
weather prove too warm, I shall
spread them, in which way they will
keep good until midsummer. Having
repeatedly heard it asserted, that
horses would not eat them, I determined
to ascertain the truth of the
assertion; accordingly, a parcel of
them were washed and cut in pieces,
and each horse served with about 3
galls. of them, when two out of five eat
them greedily, two others eat them,
but with less appetite, and the fifth refused.
They had no other food allowed
them for the night, and the next
morning not the smallest piece was to
be found in their trough.</p>

<h2>THE FRUIT GARDEN.</h2>


<p>Mr. Southwick,</p>

<p>The art of inoculating or budding
fruit trees, (although the simplest and
easiest of all things,) appears to be
deemed a mystery by most of our
farmers, and is too generally neglected,
under a belief that it is a difficult
or expensive operation. If the following
short directions should prove
the means of changing even one
thorn bush into a pear or quince
tree, I shall be fully paid for the
trouble of scribbling them down.</p>

<p>In the month of August and fore
part of September, cut from the tree
you wish to increase some of the
young wood of the last summer's
growth, (the cuttings should be thrifty
and healthy) cut the leaves off, leaving
about half an inch of the foot
stalk on the cutting; at the foot, and
immediately above the foot stalk, <em>lies
the bud</em>; with a keen knife begin to
cut half an inch above the bud, and
bring out the knife a little below, taking
about half the woody substance
with it; then separate the bark from
the wood, carefully observing that the
bud be not injured in the operation.
If the operation be properly performed,
the bud will be separated from the
wood, and remain unbroken and entire
in the bark: this bark and bud
is now to be speedily inserted into the
tree you wish to change. Choose a
smooth spot in some young and
healthy branch, or sprout, and with a
keen knife cut gently through the
bark, about one inch in length, and a
small cross cut near the upper end;
separate the bark gently from the
wood at this cross cut, being careful
not to wound the bark or wood,
and immediately insert the bud, laying
it smooth and even under the bark
of the tree; with a string of bass wood
bark, or woollen yarn, tie it in so as to
hold it close to the wood, being careful
not to injure the bud nor foot
stock&mdash;and the operation is done.&mdash;In
two or three weeks after, the bud
will have united to the wood, and the
tyings should be loosened or taken
away. The bud will remain dormant
until the next spring. In April following,
they should be examined, and
if the buds then appear healthy and
vigorous, the branch should be cut
off immediately above the bud, and
removed: in a few weeks this bud
will take place of the old branch, and
in two years produce fruit of the kind
you wish.</p>

<p>By this simple operation, the ordinary
sour peach tree, which is an
incumberer of the ground, may be
made to yield the delicious Rare Ripe,
the Early Ann, or other favourite
peaches; or may be converted into a
plum tree: and the ordinary <em>wild
plum tree</em> may be made to yield the
richest and most delicious of our cultivated
plums and peaches; our thorn
bushes may be made to yield the
rich and luscious pear; and our crab
apple stalks be loaded with the finest
varieties of our cultivated apples and
cherries; apricots and nectarines are
equally susceptible of improvement
by the same easy means; nay, our
wild gooseberry bushes may be converted
into the best varieties, and our
native grape may be made to yield an
elegant dessert fruit.&mdash;All which I

<p>A pear tree, brought from Holland,

Avenue at the intersection of Thirteenth
Street, New York. This is
probably the oldest fruit tree in America.
About 70 years ago the branches
of the tree decayed and fell off,
and at that time it was supposed the
tree was dying; but without any artificial
means being resorted to, new
shoots germinated and gradually supplied
the room of their predecessors.
The tree now is in full health and vigour,
and appears to be not more
than 30 years old; the fruit ripens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>

<p><i>On raising young Potatoes in the
Winter months.</i>&mdash;In the beginning of
May, lay a quantity of the largest ox-noble
Potatoes, on a dry cellar floor,
two or three deep, and turn them
over once in about three weeks, rubbing
off all the white sprouts as they
appear, but not the spawn or rudiments
of the young potatoes. At the
end of September, have ready a few
boxes; at the bottom of each put six
inches of decayed leaves, dried to a
vegetable mould, and place upon it a
single layer of potatoes, close to each
other; then put another layer of the
same mould, six inches deep, then
another of potatoes, and so on till the
boxes are full.&mdash;Set the boxes in a
dry covered place, free from frost,
never giving them any water.&mdash;They
will produce good fine young potatoes
in December; and those which are
ready may be taken off, and the old
potatoes replaced until the remainder
of the produce shall be ready.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><i>Cure for foundered horses, by a
surgical operation.</i>&mdash;"The operation
has succeeded admirably and will probably
lead to a similar practice in the
human subject. It has hitherto failed
frequently in the <i>Tic Doloureux</i>
and other diseases, either from the
regeneration of the divided nerve producing
a union and restoration of sensation,
or from the effect being produced
by the swelling of the ends of
the cut nerve sufficient to effect the
union. But the excision of two inches
in length effectually prevents such
a restoration of feeling. Mr. Sewell,
the well known assistant professor at
the Veterinary College, who has the
exclusive claim to this improvement,
in the course of the last eighteen
months, performed this operation on
above 100 horses, with uniform success,
except perhaps two or three
cases, in which there was great organical
disease of the foot. Although
the operation requires the skill of
Mr. Sewell, it is very simple. It
consists in cutting down upon the
trunks of the nerves which enter the
foot in contact with the arteries, on
each side of either the small or large
pastern joint, and then removing a
piece of the nerve. A few minutes
after the operation, the animal walks
and trots like a sound horse, which
just before could scarcely move at all,
and then in extreme pain. The principle
is obvious&mdash;it is that of removing
the conductors of sensation from
the seat in the disease to the brain.
The division of the arteries accompanying
the nerves is carefully avoided."&mdash;<cite>Journ.

<p><i>To destroy insects which infest

whitewash&mdash;apply this mixture with
a brush, to the trees, as soon as the
sap begins to rise, and wash the stems
and large boughs with it, taking care
to have it done in dry weather, that
it may adhere and withstand rain. In
the course of the ensuing summer,
this will be found to have removed
all the moss and insects, and give to
the bark a fresh and green appearance.
The trial is simple, and not
attended with much trouble, expense,
or danger.</p>

<p><i>Method of forcing Fruit Trees to
bear fruit.</i>&mdash;With a sharp knife make
a cut in the bark of the branch, which
you mean to force to bear, and not far
from the place where it is connected
with the stem; or if it be a small
branch, or shoot, near where it is joined
to the larger bough. The cut is
to go round the branch, or to encircle
it, and to penetrate to the wood. A
<em>quarter of an inch</em> from this cut, you
make a second cut, like the first,
round the branch, so that by both encircling
the branch, you have marked
a ring upon the branch a quarter of
an inch broad, between the two cuts.
The bark between these two cuts you
take clean away, with the knife, down
to the wood, removing even the fine
inner bark which lies upon the wood;
so that no connection whatever remains
between the two parts of the
bark, but the bare and naked wood
appears white and smooth. But this
bark ring, which is to compel the

the connexion of the bark that had

without any detriment to the tree, or

the artificial wound soon again grows

<h2>HISTORICAL SKETCHES, &amp;c.</h2>


<p>The first Americans who are known
to have visited the Western country,
were James M'Bride, and several
others, who in the year 1754 descended
the Ohio river, as far as the mouth
of Kentucky river.</p>

<p>In 1769, Colonel Daniel Boon, and
a few others, undertook to explore
this vast wilderness, then so little
known. After many hardships and
fatigues, they reached the neighbourhood
of Lexington, where they remained
until 1771.</p>

<p>In 1775, Colonel Boon, with a party
of soldiers and emigrants, built
fort Boonsborough, which was the first
settlement made in the state of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding many obstacles,
the inhabitants of Kentucky were estimated,
in 1784, at 12,000 souls.&mdash;No
settlements were made north of
the Ohio, until three or four years afterwards.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, 1786, the
"Ohio Company" was formed at
Boston, consisting of officers and soldiers
of the Revolution, who, by an
act of Congress, were entitled to a
military grant of land, in the territory
northwest of the Ohio. This company
completed a contract with Congress
for one million five hundred
thousand acres, on the 27th of Nov.
1787. An association of 46 men, under
Gen. Rufus Putnam, proceeded
to take possession of the purchase;
and on the 7th April following, they
pitched their camp and cleared the
ground where Marietta now stands.</p>

<p>In 1788, Congress passed an ordinance
establishing a colonial government
over the Northwest Territory.
Arthur St. Clair was appointed governor.</p>

<p>Cincinnati was first called Losantiville,
but Governor St. Clair, in 1790,
altered its name. In 1789, the population
of this place consisted of only
eleven families.</p>

<p>In 1792, a Presbyterian church
was erected at Cincinnati; and the
citizens were compelled by law, to
take their fire arms with them, when
they attended church. The first school
was also established this year, and consisted
of about 30 scholars.</p>

<p>In 1792, the small pox broke out
among the soldiers at Fort Washington,
and one third of the citizens and
soldiers fell victims to its ravages.&mdash;[This
was the same year it spread
throughout Boston.]</p>

<p>Since the above period, the western
country has increased in a ratio "truly
astonishing."</p>

<p>In 1810, the population of Cincinnati
was estimated at 2300; in 1813,
at about 4000; and in 1819, at more
than 10,000; "an increase truly astonishing."
The greatest part of the
population are stated to be from the
middle and northern states; but there
is also a mixed assemblage of emigrants,
"from almost every part of
Christendom; and it is not uncommon
to hear three or four different
languages spoken in the streets at the
same time."</p>

<p>In 1819, in Cincinnati, there were
1890 buildings, many of brick and
stone, of two stories and upwards; 10
places of public worship, a college,
five banks, court-house, jail, two market
houses, several manufactories, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some of the religious societies were
formed in Cincinnati, with only ten
members; and all have been created
within 16 years. There are also several
Bible societies, Sabbath school
societies, a medical society, humane
society, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of steam-boats,
considerable attention has been
paid at Cincinnati to exportation; and
from October, 1818, to March, 1819,
it amounted to $1,334,080, and consisted
of flour, pork, bacon, lard, tobacco,
&amp;c.; while the amount of imports,
for the same period, amounted
to only $500,000. In 1817, the imports
amounted to $1,442,266, and
in 1818, to $1,619,000! They seem
to be convinced that the only way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
relieve the western states from their
"present embarrassments," is to <em>export
more and import less</em>, which will
soon effect a rapid change in their
affairs.</p>

<p>About 60 steam-boats, from 25 to
700 tons, and many of them finished
in a style of elegance and taste, are
now in successful operation, and most
of them have been built within two or
three years.</p>

<p>There are three auctioneers in Cincinnati,
25 attorneys, 22 physicians, 3
companies of "Independent Military,"
handsomely uniformed, whose
appearance is "nowise inferior to the
Eastern Military."</p>

<p>Three newspapers are now printed
at Cincinnati, all upon an imperial
sheet.</p>

<p>It is estimated, that 120,000 bushels
of salt are sold annually at Cincinnati,
which at $1.50 amounts to $180,000.
The various kinds of lumber sold are
estimated at $150,000 a year.</p>

<p>We might enlarge these items, and
several other articles worthy of record,
but our limits will not permit.</p>

<h2>THE ROBBER DISAPPOINTED.</h2>


<p>A few months ago, a farmer living
a few miles from Easton, sent his
daughter on horseback to that town,
to procure from the bank smaller
notes in exchange for one of one hundred
dollars. When she arrived
there the bank was shut, and she
endeavoured to effect her object by
offering it at several stores, but could
not get her note changed. She had
not gone far on her return, when a
stranger rode up to the side of her
horse, and accosted her with so much
politeness that she had not the slightest
suspicion of any evil intention on
his part. After a ride of a mile or
two, employed in very social conversation,
they came to a retired part of
the road, and the gentleman commanded
her to give him the bank
note. It was with some difficulty
that she could be made to believe
him in earnest, as his demeanour had
been so friendly; but the presentation
of a pistol placed the matter beyond
a doubt, and she yielded to necessity.
Just as she held the note to
him, a sudden puff of wind blew it
into the road, and carried it gently
several yards from them. The discourteous
knight alighted to overtake
it, and the lady whipped her
horse to get out of his power, and
the other horse who had been left
standing by her side, started off with
her. His owner fired a pistol, which
only tended to increase the speed of
all parties, and the young lady arrived
safely at home with the horse of the
robber, on which was a pair of saddlebags.
When these were opened,
they were found to contain, besides a
quantity of counterfeit bank notes,
<em>fifteen hundred dollars in good money</em>!
The horse was a good one,
and when saddled and bridled, was
thought to be worth at least as much
as the bank note that was stolen.</p>

<p>As this story is somewhat wonderful,
I enclose you my name as a
voucher for the truth of it, and am
yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>MARIVAUX.</h2>


<p>The following anecdotes from <cite>Esprit
de Marivaux</cite>, a book, probably,
not known to many of your readers,
may serve to amuse some of them.</p>

<p>Marivaux was scarcely less remarkable
for his indolence than his
wit.&mdash;He was said to be "by nature
the laziest creature in the world;"
but his goodness appeared on the
most trifling circumstances. He was
one day setting out for the country
with Mad. Lallemand de Bez. Marivaux
and the lady's sister were already
in the coach; she staid behind
to give some orders to her domestics.
In this interval, a sturdy young fellow,
about eighteen or twenty, plump
and fresh coloured, came to the coach
door begging. Marivaux, struck with
the contrast between the appearance
and profession of the man, looked
out, and reproved him. "Are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
not ashamed," said he, "a young fellow
in perfect health and vigour, to
have the meanness to beg your bread,
when you might procure it by honest
labour?" The fellow, struck with
this rebuke, was, at first, confounded
and silent; but presently afterwards,
scratching his head, exclaimed with a
shrug and a sigh, "<em>Ah! sir, if you
did but know&mdash;I am so lazy!</em>" Marivaux,
who was himself sensible of
the pain of labour, was so pleased
with the fellow's confession, that he
gave him a crown.</p>

<p>Fontenelle having heard that Marivaux
was sick, and having just reason
to fear that he, who never laid by
any money, might be in want of it at
such an exigence, went to him, and
when they were alone, told him his
suspicions. "Perhaps," says he,
"more money may be convenient
to you than you have by you.&mdash;Friends
should never wait to be solicited;
here is a purse with a hundred
louis d'ors, which you must permit
me to leave at your disposal."&mdash;"I
consider them (said Marivaux) as
received and used; permit me now
to return them with the gratitude that
such a favour ought to excite."&mdash;"What
benevolence and generosity,
in one of these friends," says the author,
"what delicacy and greatness of
mind in the other!"</p>

<p><i>A curious phenomenon.</i>&mdash;Extract
of a letter dated May 4th, 1820, from
a respectable physician of Northumberland,
Pennsylvania, to an eminent
member of the faculty in this city.</p>

<p>"About twelve years ago the wife
of the parish minister had twins. She
was a debilitated nervous woman.
Her mother a healthy old lady of seventy-five,
who firmly believed the
prayers of the faithful could remove
mountains, began to think what a
comfortable thing it would be, if she
could nurse one of the twins. The
consequence was, that her breasts
filled with milk, and she nursed it
for twelve months, affording all that
time an abundant supply, to the great
relief of the mother.</p>

<p>"This story cannot be contradicted;
for the most respectable persons
in Northumberland have related it to
me, persons who could not be deceived,
and would not deceive me.
They say that she often carried the
child abroad in the course of her visiting,
telling the wonder wherever
she went, and giving her friends ocular
demonstration of the lactiferous
miracle."</p>

<p><i>Works of Fiction.</i>&mdash;Hannah More,
in her last work, remarking on the
subject of "unprofitable reading,"
observes, "many works of fiction
may be read with safety, some even
with profit; But the constant familiarity
even with such as are not exceptionable
in themselves, relaxes the
mind that wants hardening, dissolves
the heart which wants fortifying, stirs
the imagination which wants quieting,
irritates the passions which want
calming, and, above all, disinclines
and disqualifies for active virtues, and
for spiritual exercises. The habitual
indulgence in such reading is a
silent, mining mischief. Though
there is no act, and no moment, in
which any open assault on the mind
is made, yet the constant habit performs
the work of a mental atrophy;
it produces all the symptoms of decay,
and the danger is not less for
being more gradual, and, therefore,
less suspected."</p>

<h2>THE SPANISH INQUISITION.</h2>


<p>During the reign of Ferdinand and
Isabella, and in the Pontificate of Innocent
VIII. the Inquisition was established
for the prosecution of heretics.
It was originally intended to take cognizance
of only the Jews and Moors&mdash;but
so rapidly did it extend its influence,
that during the sway of Torquemada,
the first Inquisitor-General, it
was calculated that 6000 persons were
burnt by his order; and upwards of
20,000 fell victims in various other
ways. From the above period to the
present time, it is impossible to calculate
the number of persons who
have fallen victims to its horrid cruelties.
The late revolutions in Spain
have abolished the Inquisition, opened
the doors of its prisons, and set the
captives free. This measure alone is
a subject of the highest congratulation
to the friends of freedom throughout
the world.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ellery.</i>&mdash;The venerable Mr.
Ellery, the subject of the extract
which we give below, was one of the
signers of the Declaration of Independence,
and upwards of ninety years
old when he died. The writer of the
letter is a gentleman of Rhode Island,
of much distinction, who was intimately
acquainted with the deceased.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Extract of a letter, dated Newport,
(R. I.) March 14, 1820</i>.</p>

<p>"Old Mr. Ellery died like a philosopher.
In truth death, in its common
form, never came near him. His
strength wasted gradually for the last
year, until he had not enough left to
draw in his breath, and so he ceased
to breathe. The day on which he
died, he got up and dressed himself,
took his old flag-bottomed chair, without
arms, in which he had sat for
more than half a century, and was
reading Tully's Offices in the Latin
without glasses, though the print was
as fine as that of the smallest pocket
Bible. Dr. W. stopped in on his
way to the Hospital, as he usually
did; and on perceiving the old gentlemen
could scarcely raise his eyelids
to look at him, took his hand,
and found that his pulse was gone.
After drinking a little wine and water,
Dr. W. told him his pulse beat
stronger. "O yes, Doctor, I have a
charming pulse. But," he continued,
"it is idle to talk to me in this
way. I am going off the stage of life,
and it is a great blessing that I go
free from sickness, pain and sorrow."
Some time after, his daughter, finding
him become extremely weak,
wished him to be put to bed, which
he at first objected to, saying he felt
no pain, and there was no occasion
for his going to bed. Presently after,
however, fearing he might possibly
fall out of his chair, he told
them they might get him upright in
the bed, so that he could continue to
read. They did so, and he continued
reading Cicero very quietly for
some time; presently they looked at
him and found him dead, sitting in
the same posture, with the book under
his chin, as a man who becomes
drowsy and goes to sleep."</p>

the advanced age of 82, being born
on the 10th of October, 1738, in
Chester county, Pennsylvania. His
genius and industry as a painter have
never been surpassed, and his productions

every facility to American artists&mdash;he
viewed our progress in arts and in

long absence did not alienate his affections
from his native land. "Yesterday,"
said he to an American,
"was fifty years since I first arrived

on the top of the Canterbury coach,
and stopping about two miles from
London, at a mean tavern, and taking
a dinner before I entered the metropolis
to seek my fortune; and I could
not avoid yesterday going to the same
tavern, calling for a dinner alone in
the same room, looking back on the

<h2>MISCELLANY.</h2>


<p><i>Other people's eyes the cause of
ruin.</i>&mdash;Almost all the parts of the
body, says Dr. Franklin, require
some expense. The feet demand
shoes; the legs stockings; the rest
of the body, clothing; and the stomach
a good deal of victuals. Our
eyes, though exceedingly useful, ask,
when reasonable, only the cheap assistance
of spectacles, which would
not much impair our finances. But
the eyes of <em>other people</em> are the eyes
that ruin us. If all but myself were
blind, I should want neither fine
clothes, fine house nor fine furniture.</p>


<p><i>Enormous Bird.</i>&mdash;Mr. Henderson
has discovered, in New Siberia, the
claws of a bird, measuring each a
yard in length; and the Yaknts assured
him they had frequently in their
hunting excursions, met with skeletons,
and even feathers of this bird,
the quills of which were large enough
to admit a man's arm. This is a fact
in support of the tradition, that the
earth was formerly inhabited by giants,
for men, not exceeding ourselves
in stature, would have been helpless
against birds of prey of this magnitude.</p>


<p><i>Martial glory.</i>&mdash;In the Edinburgh
Review of Dr. Seybert's "Statistical
Annals of the United States," there
is an admonition to the Americans to
abstain from martial glory. "We
can inform them," (says the Reviewer)
"what are the inevitable consequences
of being too fond of glory. Taxes
upon every article which enters into
the mouth, or covers the back, or is
placed under the foot&mdash;taxes upon
every thing which is pleasant to see,
hear, feel, smell, or taste&mdash;taxes upon
warmth, light, or locomotion&mdash;taxes
on every thing on earth, and the
waters under the earth&mdash;of every
thing that comes from abroad, or is
grown at home&mdash;taxes on the raw
material&mdash;taxes on every fresh value
that is added to it by the industry of
men&mdash;taxes on the sauce which pampers
man's appetite, and the drug that
restores him to health&mdash;on the ermine
which decorate the judge, and the
rope which hangs the criminal&mdash;on
the poor man's salt, and the rich man's
spice&mdash;on the brass nails of the coffin,
and the ribands of the bride&mdash;at bed
or at board, couchant or levant, we
must pay! The school boy whips
his taxed top&mdash;the beardless youth
manages his taxed horse with a taxed
bridle on a taxed road; and the dying
Englishman, pouring his medicine
which has paid seven per cent., into
a spoon which has paid fifteen per
cent., flings himself back upon his
chintz bed, which has paid twenty-two
per cent.&mdash;makes his will on an
8l. stamp, and expires in the arms of
an apothecary, who has paid 100l. for
the privilege of putting him to death.&mdash;His
whole property is then taxed
from 2 to 10 per cent., besides the
probate. Large fees are demanded
for burying him in the chancel; his
virtues are handed down to posterity
on taxed marble; and he is then gathered
to his fathers to be taxed no
more."</p>


<p><i>Law Intelligence.&mdash;R. &amp; C. Rhodes,
vs. Peleg Congdon.</i> The court are of
opinion that the legal mode of computing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
interest, where there have
been partial payments, is, to cast the
interest on the principal, up to the
time of the first payment, which add
to the principal; and from this sum
deduct the payment, and so on
through all the endorsements when
one year or more intervenes between
the payments, provided the sum paid
is greater than the sum due for interest,
when the payment is made; if
less than such sum is paid, to be applied
towards the payment of interest;
and where the note or mortgage
has not run one year, then, cast the
interest tin the payment, as well as
the principal, up to the end of the
year.&mdash;The above decision was made
by the Supreme Court, at their late
April term, in Kent, Maryland.</p>


<p><i>On Books.</i>&mdash;Dr. Aikin in his valuable
letters from a Father to a Son,
thus elucidates the value of a Library:&mdash;"Imagine
(says he) that we had it
in our power to call up the shades of
the greatest and wisest men that ever
existed, and obliged them to converse
with us on the most interesting topics&mdash;what
an inestimable privilege
should we think it!&mdash;how superior to
all common enjoyments! But in a
well furnished library we, in fact,
possess this power. We can question
Xenophon and Cæsar on their
campaigns&mdash;make Demosthenes and
Cicero plead before us&mdash;join in the
audiences of Socrates and Plato, and
receive demonstrations from Euclid
and Newton. In books we have the
choicest thoughts of the ablest men
in their best dress. We can, at pleasure,
exclude dulness and impertinence,
and open our doors to wit and
good sense alone. Without books, I
have never been able to pass a single
day to my entire satisfaction; with
them, no day has been so dark as not
to have had its pleasure. Even pain
and sickness have for a time been
charmed away by them. By the easy
provision of a book in my pocket,
I have frequently worn through long
nights and days in the most disagreeable
parts of my profession, with all
the difference in my feelings between
calm content and fretful impatience."</p>


<p><i>European Literature.</i>&mdash;-The catalogue
of the fair of Leipsic, for 1819,
contains one thousand two hundred
and sixteen new works, in Greek, Latin,
and German; thirty-eight novels,
thirty dramatic pieces, twenty-seven
geographical maps, fifty-nine pieces
of music; and seventy-seven works in
foreign languages, the French, Italian,
Polish, Bohemian, Danish, and Spanish.</p>


<p><i>Egypt.</i>&mdash;The last news from this
country, of inexhaustible curiosity,
contains information respecting the
labours of that magnificent undertaking,
the Grand Canal of Alexandria.
Already the primary effects of it have
given an impulse to agriculture and
industry, such as might be expected
from it. The culture of cotton, of
the sugar cane, of the mulberry tree,
is beginning to assume a degree of
activity, as also the rearing of silkworms;
and some important new manufactories
are already at work, holding
out the promise of future commercial
prosperity.</p>


<p><i>Lakes in New Holland.</i>&mdash;It appears
that two large seas or sheets of water
have been discovered in the interior
of New Holland, supplied chiefly by
two considerable rivers, whose sources
are on the western side of the Blue
Mountains.</p>


<p><i>Missions in India.</i>&mdash;The Reverend
James Bryce, in a sermon preached
in Calcutta, March, 1818, said, "Zeal
the most active and disinterested, and
diligence the most assiduous, have not
been spared by the Christian missionary,
in his pious attempts to convert
the natives of India. But, alas! it
may be doubted, if at this day he
boasts a single proselyte to his creed,
over whom he is warranted to rejoice."</p>


<p><i>Increase of Taxes in England.</i>&mdash;A
meeting of the magistrates, and
other owners and occupiers of land
in Monmouthshire, was held lately at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Abergavenny, for the purpose of petitioning
Parliament for relief. The
1st clause of the petition states, "That
the farmer at this time can obtain but
little more for his corn than in the
year 1793, although the taxes are increased
<em>four fold</em>, and the poors'
rates above trebled, since that period."</p>


<p><i>British Exports.</i>&mdash;The exports of
white and plain calicoes from Great
Britain, were&mdash;In 1814, 58,928,174
yards; in 1815, 65,669 930; in 1816,
50,251,102; and in 1817, 63,525,555.</p>

<p><i>Scull of king Robert the Bruce.</i>&mdash;Lately
in the church of Dumfermline,
the grave of the celebrated
warrior king Robert the Bruce was
opened, in presence of a numerous
assemblage of men of rank and science.
The scull, and various parts
of the skeleton, were in a state of
preservation: now that the opinions
of Gall and Spurzheim are not passed
over as mere pieces of quackery, the
curiosity of anatomists, and even of
the public in general, was excited by
this invaluable opportunity of inspecting
and examining such a scull as
that of king Robert the Bruce. We
are told, that several of the propensities
of this great man, were strongly
expressed in the eminences of the
scull&mdash;in particular, that the organ of
<em>combativeness</em> was the most prominent
of the whole.</p>


<p><i>Power of Ice.</i>&mdash;The following singular
account of the power of ice,
is taken from an English periodical
publication, of January 1820.</p>

<p>"Huyghens, in order to try the
force with which ice would expand
itself when confined, filled a cannon,
the sides of which were an
inch thick, with water, and then
closed the mouth and touch hole so
that none could escape. The instrument,
thus filled was exposed in a
strong freezing air. In less than
twelve hours the water within was
frozen, and began to dilate itself
with such force, that it actually burst
the piece in two different places.
Mathematicians have calculated the
force of the ice on this occasion; such
a force, they say, would raise a weight
of 27,730 pounds. From hence,
therefore, we need not be surprised
at the effects of ice destroying the
substance of vegetables, trees, and
even splitting rocks, when the frost
is carried to excess.</p>

<p>"The late frost produced quite a
phenomenon at the back of the Cold-Bath-Fields
prison, where the New
River Water Company's leading iron
pipes cross the Fleet Ditch. The
pipes not having been properly cemented,
or the cement having worn
away, the water had spouted up high
in the air: and when the very severe
weather was, it commenced freezing,
and continued to freeze till a large
cascade or fountain of ice was actually
formed, as white as snow, about
ten feet above the pipe, and reaching
in large icicles concocted together
nearly to the water in the ditch below.
The bank was covered with a
thick coat of ice from the spray,
which blew from the water-fall. The
circumference of the frozen pile
could not be less than eight or ten
feet, at half that height from the
pipe. At a distance it was not possible
to distinguish it from water
spouting and falling down; and when
close to it the ice looked so clear and
beautiful, and the rarity of such an
object being considered, made every
one behold it with wonder and admiration."</p>


<p><i>Ingenious Machine.</i>&mdash;The National
Fire and Life Insurance Association,
(London) have introduced a newly invented
machine, which possesses the
following properties: In case of fire,
it instantly awakens the party in whose
sleeping room it is placed&mdash;immediately
lights a lamp&mdash;makes known
the hour of the night, and not only
that a fire has commenced, but in what
room.</p>


<p><i>Chinese Superstition.</i>&mdash;The following
article, which gives some idea of
Chinese superstition, is taken from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Peking Gazette:&mdash;"The 1st of May,
1818, there arose suddenly at Peking,
a tempest, that obscured the heavens
and filled the air with sand and dust.
The Emperor, thinking it was a judgment
from heaven, was very much
alarmed, and very anxious to know
what it meant: he assembled his ministers
of state, and commanded them
to endeavour to discover the cause
of it: he then reprimanded his astronomers
for not having foretold it to
him. 'You announced to me,' said
he to them, 'three days ago, the happy
influence the stars had over me,
foretelling a long and prosperous life;
this was mere flattery, while you either
would not or could not tell me
of this impending misfortune.' Three
of those <em>sages</em> gave their opinion, that
the cause of this tempest was the dismissal
of the late chief minister, <i>Sung
Tajin</i>, and advised him to recall him;
but his Majesty, far from approving
their proposal, reprimanded them for
having the presumption to meddle
with the royal prerogative. The body
of mathematicians gave in their
opinion, assuring him that if this
whirlwind, accompanied with dust,
continued during the whole day, it
indicated a perverse conduct and variance
of opinion between the sovereign
and his ministers, as well as a
great drought and famine. If the
wind disturbed the sand, moved the
stones, and made much noise, inundations
were to be expected; and if the
dust continued to fall one hour more,
the plague would rage in the southern
regions, and half the inhabitants to
the southeast would be sick."</p>

<p>The Gazette expresses his Majesty's
uneasiness at this long drought.
His Majesty has ordered his sons to
fast, to pray, and offer sacrifices to
heaven, to earth, and to the god of
wind. There was to be a solemn festival
on the 25th of May, 1819, at
which all the princes, ministers, and
nobles, were to appear in procession,
wearing mourning as a mark of their
contrition!</p>


<p><i>To Farmers' Wives.</i>&mdash;A most excellent
method of making BUTTER,
is now practised in England, which
effectually prevents its changing and
becoming rancid.&mdash;The day before
churning, scald the cream in a clean
iron kettle, over a clear fire, taking
care that it does not boil over. As
soon as it begins to boil, or is fully
scalded, strain it, when the particles
of milk, which tended to sour and
change the butter, are separated and
left behind. Put the vessel into a
tub of water, in a cellar, till the next
morning, when it will be ready for
churning, and become butter in less
than quarter of the time required in
the common method. It will also be
hard, with peculiar additional sweetness,
and will not change. The labour
in this way is less than the other, as
the butter comes so much sooner,
and saves so much time in working
out the buttermilk.&mdash;By this method
good butter may be made in the hottest
weather.</p>

<h2>DIED,</h2>


<p>In the parish of Aiglish, in the vicinity
of Killarney, Ireland, at the
very advanced age of <em>one hundred
and fifteen years</em>, <span class="smcap">Theodore O'Sullivan</span>,
the celebrated Irish Bard.&mdash;This
extraordinary man, who was a
great composer in his native language,
expired suddenly, in April
last, whilst sowing oats in the field of
his great grand children, and retaining
his faculties to the last moment!
He is said to have sung to the plough
one of his favourite lyrics, and actually
breathed his last at the final
stanza of his national melody. The
deceased also followed the occupation
of a cooper, and is said to have
made a churn, from which butter was
taken for the christening of his 26th
great grand child.</p>

<p>Lately, at the hospital at Bourges,
France, aged 103 years, and 13 days,

blind, and employed for upwards of
60 years in turning a grindstone.</p>

<h2>FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</h2>


<p>The more disinterested our benevolence, the nearer
we approach to the gods, was the sentiment of a reflecting
heathen, who lived at a remote period of antiquity.
Disinterested benevolence, though of rare
occurrence, is nevertheless, to the honour of human
nature, sometimes witnessed. 'When it is, the effect,
like that produced by beholding an island of verdure
in a sandy desert, or a retiring evergreen in the wintry
waste, is in the highest degree cheering and delightful.
DAVID G. SEIXAS, a young man of this
city, of limited pecuniary resources, but of truly
philanthropic and elevated views, has for some time
past gratuitously instructed a number of deaf and
dumb children, with singular success. His unobtrusive
merit has at length in some measure become
cognisant to the public; and as it is ascertained that
there is a considerable number of unfortunate individuals,
of this description, in the city <em>and its vicinity</em>,
an association has been formed, under the most respectable
auspices, for establishing an Institution for
their instruction.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is hoped and believed, that exertions
to promote so excellent an object, will be aided
with ample and willing patronage.</p>

<p class="center">TO THE EDITORS OF THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</p>


<p>My leisure hours are mostly employed in holding a
sort of literary <em>chit-chat</em> with some favourite author or
editor; but I am never more agreeably entertained
than at your <cite>Evening Fire-side</cite>, by the various topics
there introduced and discussed. The Essayist <em>remarks</em>
the pride, extravagance, and vices, which at present
prevail, and <em>teaches</em> us that these are unworthy of rational
beings, and that their opposites, humility, prudence,
and virtue, with the exercise of charity and
forbearance, can alone ensure us felicity. The Agriculturist
descants on the improvement of the soil, the
rearing of flocks and herds, and the enviable pleasures
of rural occupations. The Mechanic sets forth the
superior advantages of some new invention; while
the man of science communicates the result of ingenious
experiments in the particular branches of knowledge
which have engaged his attention. And last,
though not less a favourite than the rest, is the Bard,
whose title to poetic inspiration is not unfrequently
evinced by his giving</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"<i>to airy nothing</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>"A local habitation and a name</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While thus highly amused and instructed myself,
I am unable, being of humble capacity, to contribute
in return to the edification of others, unless by occasionally
communicating what I may chance to glean
in the course of some of my <em>literary</em> peregrinations.
As this may not be unacceptable, I send you, as a
token of my good will, and desire for the prosperity
of your interesting Miscellany, a <em>scrap</em> of American
poesy, which, though published a few years since
in some of the public journals, it is believed will be
new to many of your readers. The writer is a young
lady of Virginia, by the name of HENNING, who
thus modestly speaks of a production, which, it must
be admitted, is alike creditable to herself, her sex and
country:&mdash;"The subject which I have selected, has
already employed the talents of an eminent poet,
(<i>Akenside</i>,) and as he has gathered in the rich harvest
which it presented to the sickle of his genius, I
must, like Ruth of old, be content to collect the
scattered ears, not however expecting the same result
to my employment as that which attended my
fair-famed predecessor."&mdash;Your friend,</p>

a rain for several years so beneficial in its
consequences as the late one, taking into
consideration the season, the dry state of
the ground and the quantity fallen. An

<h2>TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS.</h2>


<p>We present you with the <span class="smcap">SIXTH</span> number
of the <span class="smcap">Rural Magazine</span>. You will
recollect the terms of subscription. We
were now to receive the first year's payment&mdash;<span class="smcap">THREE</span>
dollars; and annually, from
this time, the same sum. Your punctuality
will confer on us an additional favour,
and afford a criterion by which we may,
in part, judge of our future support.</p>

<p>We contemplate no material alteration
in our plan. In the first part of each
number we shall present you, as heretofore,
with essays of different kinds; in the
second, with agricultural subjects; and in
the third, or last division, with a miscellany
made up of every variety that presents.</p>

<p>Our present list of subscribers is about
what we had anticipated, but is not yet
sufficiently large. We calculate, however,
before the close of the year, to see
it so increased as to support us in our hope
of success. This will, in some measure,
depend on those who have seen and desire
the continuance of the work. Could
each of you procure among your neighbours
two or three, or even one additional
subscriber, our purpose would be answered.
We therefore request your
assistance in this way, and enclose a
subscription paper. Subscribers will be
expected to take the numbers from the
beginning of the year. A complete index
and title-page will be furnished for each
volume.</p>

26; barley, 26; and oats, 40, for one.&mdash;Wheat
holds only the fifth rank in value
in the harvest of Flanders. In England,
wheat never yields more, on an average,
than 10 or 11 for one; barley, something
less than 10 to 1; and oats only between 8
and 9 for one. In some highly ameliorated
farms in the county of Suffolk, Arthur
Young reports a produce of 36 bushels of
wheat, and 64 bushels of barley to the acre;
and that in the county of Kent, soils of
middling quality, equally ameliorated, yield
per acre 52 bushels of wheat, and the same
quantity of barley. But in Flanders, there
are soils which yield much more than this&mdash;namely,
72 bushels of wheat, 120 of barley,
128 of beans, and 72 of coleseed.&mdash;These,
however, are extreme cases, which
do not affect the general question of comparative
growths; while, however, they
shew that the amelioration of land, in any
country, is calculated greatly to increase
its productiveness.</p></div>
